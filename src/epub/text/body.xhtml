<h2>Chapter I. <br/> Tolling the Bell</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p><i>The Owl</i> shows its blue and gilt cover on the
bookstalls every Saturday morning. Thursday
nights are therefore nights of turmoil in the offices in
Fleet Street. They are always wearing nights; more
so, of course, in hot weather than in cold. They are
nights of discomfort for the office-boy and of
something worse for the editor.</p>

<p>Spencer Hastings edited <i>The Owl</i>, and owned a
third of it; and the little paper’s success showed him to
possess both brains and capacity for hard work. For a
man of thirty-three he had achieved much; but that
capacity for work was hard tested—especially on
Thursday nights. As to the brains, there was really no
doubt of their quality. Take, for instance, <i>The Owl</i>
“specials.” After he had thought of them and given
birth to the first, <i>The Owl</i>, really a weekly review, was
enabled to reap harvests in the way of “scoops”
without in any way degenerating into a mere purveyor of
news.</p>

<p>The thing was worked like this: If, by the grace
of God or through a member of the “special” staff
or by any other channel, there came to Hastings’s ears
a piece of Real News which might as yet be unknown
to any of the big daily or evening papers, then within
a few hours, whatever the day or night of the week,
there appeared a special edition of <i>The Owl</i>. It bore,
in place of the blue and gold, a cover of red and black.
The letterpress was sparse. The price was two pence.
The public bought the first two out of curiosity, and
the subsequent issues because they had discovered that
when the red and black jacket was seen Something
had really Happened.</p>

<p>The public bought the real <i>Owl</i> as well. It was
always original, written by men and women as yet little
known and therefore unspoilt. It was witty, exciting,
soothing, biting, laudatory, ironic, and sincere—all in
one breath and irreproachable taste.</p>

<p>And Hastings loved it. But Thursday nights, press
nights, were undoubtedly Hell. And this Thursday
night, hotter almost than its stifling day, was the very
hell of Hells.</p>

<p>He ruffled his straw-coloured hair, looking, as a
woman once said of him, rather like a stalwart and
handsome chicken. Midnight struck. He worked on,
cursing at the heat, the paper, his material, and the
fact that his confidential secretary, his right-hand
woman, was making holiday.</p>

<p>He finished correcting the proofs of his leader, then
reached for two over-long articles by new contributors.
As he picked up a blue pencil, his door burst open.</p>

<p>“What in hell——” he began; then looked up.
“Good God! Marga—Miss Warren!”</p>

<p>It was sufficiently surprising that his right-hand
woman should erupt into his room at this hour in the
night when he had supposed her many miles away in a
holiday bed; but that she should be thus, gasping,
white-faced, dust-covered, hair escaping in a shining cascade
from beneath a wrecked hat, was incredible. Never
before had he seen her other than calm, scrupulously
dressed, exquisitely tidy and faintly severe in her
beauty.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet slowly. The girl, her breath
coming in great sobs, sank limply into a chair.
Hastings rushed for the editorial bottle, glass, and siphon.
He tugged at the door of the cupboard, remembered
that he had locked it, and began to fumble for his keys.
They eluded him. He swore beneath his breath, and
then started as a hand was laid on his shoulder. He
had not heard her approach.</p>

<p>“Please don’t worry about that.” Her words came
short, jerkily, as she strove for breath. “Please,
please, listen to me! I’ve got a Story—the biggest yet!
Must have a special done now, to-night, this morning!”</p>

<p>Hastings forgot the whisky. The editor came to
the top.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” snapped the editor.</p>

<p>“Cabinet Minister dead. John Hoode’s been
killed—murdered! To-night. At his country house.”</p>

<p>“You <em>know</em>?”</p>

<p>The efficient Miss Margaret Warren was becoming
herself again. “Of course. I heard all the fuss
just after eleven. I was staying in Marling, you
know. My landlady’s husband is the police-sergeant.
So I hired a car and came straight here. I thought
you’d like to know.” Miss Warren was unemotional.</p>

<p>“Hoode killed! Phew!” said Hastings, the man,
wondering what would happen to the Party.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> a story!” said Hastings, the editor. “Any
other papers on to it yet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they can be—yet.”</p>

<p>“Right. Now nip down to Bealby, Miss Warren.
Tell him he’s got to get ready for a two-page special
<em>now</em>. He must threaten, bribe, shoot, do anything
to keep the printers at the job. Then see Miss Halford
and tell her she can’t go till she’s arranged for issue.
Then please come back here; I shall want to dictate.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Hastings,” said the girl, and walked
quietly from the room.</p>

<p>Hastings looked after her, his forehead wrinkled.
Sometimes he wished she were not so sufficient, so
calmly adequate. Just now, for an instant, she had
been trembling, white-faced, weak. Somehow the
sight, even while he feared, had pleased him.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and turned to his desk.</p>

<p>“Lord!” he murmured. “Hoode murdered.
<em>Hoode!</em>”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>“That’s all the detail, then,” said Hastings half an
hour later. Margaret Warren, neat, fresh, her golden
hair smooth and shining, sat by his desk.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Hastings.”</p>

<p>“Er—hm. Right. Take this down. ‘Cabinet
Minister Assassinated. Murder at Abbotshall——’ ”</p>

<p>“ ‘Awful Atrocity at Abbotshall,’ ” suggested the
girl softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. You’re right as usual,” Hastings
snapped. “But I always forget we have to use
journalese in the specials. Right. ‘John Hoode Done
to Death by Unknown Hand. <i>The Owl</i> most deeply
regrets to announce that at eleven o’clock last night
Mr. John Hoode, Minister of Imperial Finance, was
found lying dead in the study of his country residence,
Abbotshall, Marling. The circumstances were
such’—pity we don’t know what they really were, Miss
Warren—‘the circumstances were such as to show
immediately that this chief among England’s greatest
men had met his death at the hands of a murderer,
though it is impossible at present to throw any light
upon the identity of the criminal.’ New paragraph,
please. ‘We understand, however, that no time was
lost in communicating with Scotland Yard, who have
assigned the task of tracking down the perpetrator of
this terrible crime to their most able and experienced
officers’—always a safe card that, Miss Warren—‘No
time will be lost in commencing the work of
investigation.’ Fresh paragraph, please. ‘All England, all
the Empire, the whole world will join in offering their
heartfelt sympathy to Miss Laura Hoode, who, we
understand, is prostrated by the shock’—another safe
bet—‘Miss Hoode, as all know, is the sister of the late
minister and his only relative. It is known that there
were two guests at Abbotshall, that brilliant leader of
society, Mrs. Roland Mainwaring, and Sir Arthur
Digby-Coates, the millionaire philanthropist and
Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Conciliation.
Sir Arthur was an extremely close and lifelong friend
of the deceased and would affirm that he had not an
enemy in the world——’ ”</p>

<p>Miss Margaret Warren looked up, her eyebrows
severely interrogative.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Hastings uneasily.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that last sentence rather dangerous, Mr.
Hastings?”</p>

<p>“Hm—er—I don’t know—er—yes, you’re right,
Miss Warren. Dammit, woman, are you ever wrong
about anything?” barked Hastings; then recovered
himself. “I <em>beg</em> your pardon. I—I——”</p>

<p>There came an aloof smile. “Please don’t apologise,
Mr. Hastings. Shall I change the phrase?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” muttered Hastings. “Say, say—put
down—say——”</p>

<p>“ ‘——and are stricken aghast at the calamity which
has befallen them,’ ” suggested the girl.</p>

<p>“Excellent,” said Hastings, composure recovered.</p>

<p>“By the way, did you tell Williams to get on with
that padding? That sketch of Hoode’s life and work?
We’ve got to fill up that opposite-centre page.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Williams started on it at once.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now take this down as a separate piece.
It must be marked off with heavy black rules and
be in Clarendon or some conspicuous type. Ready?
‘<i>The Owl</i>, aghast at this dreadful tragedy, yet arises
from its sorrow and issues, on behalf of the public,
a solemn exhortation and warning. Let the authorities
see to it that the murderer is found, and found speedily.
England demands it. The author of this foul deed
must be brought swiftly to justice and punished with
the utmost rigour of the law. No effort must be
spared.’ Now a separate paragraph, please. It must
be underlined and should go on the opposite page—under
Williams’s article. ‘Aware of the tremendous
interest and concern which this terrible crime will
arouse, <i>The Owl</i> has made special arrangements to
have bulletins (in the same form as this special edition)
published at short intervals in order that the public
may have full opportunity to know what progress is
being made in the search for the criminal.</p>

<p>“ ‘These bulletins will be of extraordinary interest,
since we are in a position to announce that a special
correspondent will despatch to us (so far as is
consistent with the wishes of the police, whom we wish
to assist rather than compete with) at frequent
intervals, from the actual locus of the crime a résumé
of the latest developments.’ ” Hastings sighed relief
and leant back in his chair. “That’s all, Miss Warren.
And I hope—since the thing <em>is</em> done—that the
murderer’ll remain a mystery for a bit. We’ll look rather
prize idiots if the gardener’s boy or some one confesses
to-morrow. Get that stuff typed and down to the
printers as quick as you can, please.”</p>

<p>The girl rose and moved to the door, but paused
on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hastings,” she said, turning quickly, “what
does that last bit mean? Are you sending one of the
ordinary people down there—Mr. Sellars or Mr.
Briggs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I suppose so. What I said was all rot,
but it’ll sound well. We just want reports that are a
bit different from the others.”</p>

<p>She came nearer, her eyes wide. “Mr. Hastings,
please excuse me, but you must listen. Why not
let <i>The Owl</i> be really useful? Oh, don’t you see what
it would mean if we helped to catch the murder? Our
reputation—our sales. Why——”</p>

<p>“But I say, Miss Warren, look here, you know!
We’ve not got an office full of Holmeses. They’re
all perfectly ordinary fellers——”</p>

<p>“Colonel Gethryn,” said the girl quietly.</p>

<p>“Eh, what?” Hastings was startled. “He’d never—Miss
Warren, you’re a wonder. But he wouldn’t
take it on. He’s——”</p>

<p>“Ask him.” She pointed to the telephone at his
side.</p>

<p>“What? Now?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“But—but it’s two o’clock,” stammered Hastings.
He met the level gaze of his secretary’s blue eyes,
lifted the receiver from its hook, and asked for a
number.</p>

<p>“Hallo,” he said two minutes later, “is that
Colonel Gethryn’s flat?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said the telephone. Its voice was sleepy.</p>

<p>“Is—is Colonel Gethryn in—out—up, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Gethryn,” said the voice, “who would
infinitely prefer to be called Mr. Gethryn, is in his
flat, out of bed, and upon his feet. Also he is
beginning to become annoyed at——”</p>

<p>“Good Lord—Anthony!” said Hastings. “I didn’t
recognise your voice.”</p>

<p>“Now that you have, O Hastings, perhaps you’ll
explain why the hell you’re ringing me up at this
hour. I may mention that I am in execrable temper.
Proceed.”</p>

<p>Spencer Hastings proceeded. “Er—I—ah—that
is—er——”</p>

<p>“If those are scales,” said the telephone, “permit me
to congratulate you.”</p>

<p>Hastings tried again. “Something has happened,”
he began.</p>

<p>“No!” said the telephone.</p>

<p>“D’you think you could—I know it’s an
extraordinary thing to ask—er, but will you—er——”</p>

<p>Miss Margaret Warren rose to her feet, removed
the instrument from her employer’s hands, put the
receiver to her ear and spoke into the transmitter.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gethryn,” she said, “this is Margaret Warren
speaking. What Mr. Hastings wished to do was to
ask whether you could come down here—to the
office—at once. Oh, I know it sounds mad, but we’ve
received some amazing news, and Mr. Hastings wishes
to consult you. I can’t tell you any more over the
phone, but Mr. Hastings is sure that you’ll be willing to
help. Please come; it might mean everything to the
paper.”</p>

<p>“Miss Warren,” said the telephone sadly, “against
my will you persuade me.”</p>

<h2>Chapter II. <br/> Anthony Gethryn</h2>

<p>Anthony Ruthven Gethryn was something
of an oddity. A man of action who
dreamed while he acted; a dreamer who acted while he
dreamed. The son of a hunting country gentleman of
the old type, who was yet one of the most brilliant
mathematicians of his day, and of a Spanish lady of
impoverished and exiled family who had, before her
marriage with Sir William Gethryn, been in turn
governess, dancer, mannequin, actress, and portrait painter,
it was perhaps to be expected that he should be no
ordinary child. And he was not.</p>

<p>For even after taking into consideration the
mixture of blood and talents that were rightly his,
Anthony’s parents soon found their only child to be
possessed of far more than they had thought to give
him. From his birth he proved a refutation of the
adage that a Jack-of-all-Trades can be master of none.</p>

<p>At school and at Oxford, though appearing almost
to neglect work, he covered himself with academic
glory which outshone even that of his excellence at
racquets and Rugby football. Not only did he follow
in the mathematical tracks of his father, but also
became known as an historian and man of classics.</p>

<p>He left Oxford in his twenty-third year; read for
the bar; was called, but did not answer. He went
instead round and about the world, and did not, during
the three and a half years he was away, use a penny
other than earnings of one sort and another.</p>

<p>He returned home to settle down, painted two
pictures which he gave to his father, wrote a novel
which was lauded by the critics and brought him
not a penny, and followed up with a book of verse
which, though damned by the same critics, was yet
remunerative to the extent of one hundred and fifty
pounds.</p>

<p>Politics came next, and for some six months he
filled adequately the post of private secretary to a
Member of Parliament suspected of early promotion
to office.</p>

<p>Then, in Anthony’s twenty-eighth year, on top of
his decision to contest a seat, came the war. On the
15th of August, 1914, he was a private in an infantry
regiment; by the 1st of the following November he
had taken a commission in the artillery; on the 4th of
May, 1915, he was recovered from the damage caused
by a rifle-bullet, an attack of trench-fever, and three
pieces of shrapnel. On the 18th of July in that year he
was in Germany.</p>

<p>That calls for explanation. Anthony Ruthven
Gethryn was in Germany because his uncle, Sir Charles
Haultevieux de Courcy Gethryn, was a personage
at the War Office. Uncle Charles liked and had an
admiration for his nephew Anthony. Also, Uncle
Charles was aware that nephew Anthony spoke
German like a German, and was, when occasion demanded,
a person of tact, courage, and reliability. “A boy
with <em>guts</em>, sir. A boy with <em>guts</em>! And common
sense, sir; in spite of all this poetry-piffle and paintin’
cows in fields and girls with nothin’ on. A damnation
<em>clever</em> lad, sir!”</p>

<p>So Uncle Charles, having heard the wailings of a
friend in the Secret Service division concerning the
terrible dearth of the right men, let fall a few words
about his nephew.</p>

<p>And that is how, in the year 1915, Anthony Ruthven
Gethryn came to be, not as a prisoner, in the heart
of Germany. He was there for eighteen long months,
and when Uncle Charles next saw his nephew there
were streaks of gray in the dark hair of the thirty
year old head.</p>

<p>The results of Anthony’s visit were of much value.
A grateful Government patted him on the back,
decorated him, gave him two months’ leave, promoted him,
and then worked him as few men were worked even
during the war. It was queer work, funny work,
work in the dark, work in strange places.</p>

<p>Anthony Ruthven Gethryn left the army at the end
of 1919, at the age of thirty-three. To show for his
service he had a limp (slight), the C.M.G., the D.S.O.,
a baker’s dozen of other orders (foreign: various)
and those thick streaks of gray in his black hair.
Few save his intimate friends knew either of that
batch of medals or of his right to the title of Colonel.</p>

<p>Anthony stayed with his mother until she died,
peacefully, and then, since his father—who had
preceded his wife by some two years—had left him
no more than a few hundreds a year, looked round
for work.</p>

<p>He wrote another novel; the public were unmoved.
He painted three pictures; they would not sell. He
published another book of poems; they would not sell
either. Then he turned back to his secretaryship, his
M.P. being now a minor minister. The work was
of a sort he did not care for, and save for meeting
every now and then a man who interested him, he
was bored to extinction.</p>

<p>Then, in July of 1921, Uncle Charles fell a victim
to malignant influenza, became convalescent, developed
pneumonia, and died. To Anthony he left a dreadful
house in Knightsbridge and nine or ten thousand a
year. Anthony sold the house, set up in a flat, and,
removed from carking care, did as the fancy took him.
When he wanted to write, he wrote. When he wished
to paint, he painted. When pleasure called, he
answered. He was very happy for a year.</p>

<p>But then came trouble. When he wrote, he found
that, immediately, a picture would form in his head
and cry aloud to be put on canvas. Did he paint,
verse unprecedented, wonderful, clamoured to be
written. Did he leave England, his soul yearned for
London.</p>

<p>It was when this phase was at its worst that he
renewed a friendship, begun at Trinity, with that
eccentric but able young journalist, Spencer Hastings.
To Anthony, Hastings unbosomed his great idea—the
idea which could be made fact if there were exactly
twice as much money as Hastings possessed. Anthony
provided the capital, and <i>The Owl</i> was born.</p>

<p>Anthony designed the cover, wrote a verse for the
paper now and then; sometimes a bravura essay.</p>

<p>Often he blessed Hastings for having given him one
interest at least which, since the control of it was not
in his own hands, could not be thrown aside altogether.</p>

<p>To conclude: Anthony was suffering from three
disorders, lack of a definite task to perform, severe
war-strain, and not having met the right woman.
The first and the second, though he never spoke of
them, he knew about; the third he did not even
suspect.</p>

<h2>Chapter III. <br/> Cock Robin’s House</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>The sudden telephone message from Hastings at
two o’clock on that August morning and his
own subsequent acceptance of the suggestion that he
should be <i>The Owl’s</i> “Special Commissioner,” had at
least, thought Anthony, as he drove his car through
Kingston four hours later, remedied that lack of
something definite to do.</p>

<p>He had driven at once to <i>The Owl’s</i> headquarters,
had arranged matters with Hastings within ten
minutes, and had then telephoned to a friend—an
important official friend. To him Anthony had
outlined, sketchily, the scheme, and had been given in
reply a semi-official, “Mind you, <em>I</em> know nothing about
it if anything happens, but get ahead” blessing. He
had then driven back to his flat, packed a bag, left a
note for his man, and set out for Marling in Surrey.</p>

<p>From his official friend he had gathered that once
on the right side of Miss Hoode and his way was clear.
As he drove he pondered. How to approach the
woman? At any mention of the Press she would be
bound to shy. Finally, he put the problem to one
side.</p>

<p>The news of John Hoode’s death had not moved
him, save in the way of a passing amazement.
Anthony had seen too much of death to shed tears
over a man he had never known. And the Minister
of Imperial Finance, brilliant though he had been,
had never seized the affections of the people in the
manner of a Joe Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Passing through Halsemere, Anthony, muttering
happily to himself: “Now, who <em>did</em> kill Cock Robin?”
was struck by a horrid thought. Suppose there
should be no mystery! Suppose, as Hastings had suggested,
that the murderer had already delivered himself.</p>

<p>Then he dismissed the idea. A Cabinet Minister
murdered without a mystery? Impossible! All the
canons were against it.</p>

<p>He took his car along at some speed. By ten
minutes to eight he had reached the Bear and Key in
Marling High Street, demanded a room and breakfast,
and had been led upstairs by a garrulous landlord.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Bathed, shaved, freshly-clothed and full of breakfast,
Anthony uncurled his thin length from the best
chair in the inn’s parlour, lit his pipe, and sought the
garden.</p>

<p>Outside the door he encountered the landlord,
made inquiry as to the shortest way to Abbotshall,
and, placidly puffing at his pipe, watched with
enjoyment the effect of his question.</p>

<p>The eyes of Mr. Josiah Syme flashed with the fire
of curiosity.</p>

<p>“ ’Scuse me, sir,” he wheezed, “but ’ave you come
down along o’ this—along o’ these <em>’appenings</em> up at
the ’ouse?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>Mr. Syme tried again. “Be you a ’tective, sir?”
he asked in a conspiratorial wheeze. “If so, Joe
Syme might be able to ’elp ye.” He leant forward
and added in yet a lower whisper: “My eldest gel,
she’s an ’ousemaid up along at Abbotshall.”</p>

<p>“Is she indeed,” said Anthony. “Wait here till I
get my hat; then we’ll walk along together. You can
show me the way.”</p>

<p>“Then—then—you are a ’tective, sir.”</p>

<p>“What exactly I am,” said Anthony, “God Himself
may know. I do not. But you can make five pounds
if you want it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Syme understood enough.</p>

<p>As they walked, first along the white road, then
through fields and finally along the bank of that
rushing, fussy, barely twenty-yards wide little river,
the Marle, Mr. Syme told what he knew.</p>

<p>Purged of repetitions, biographical meanderings, and
excursions into rustic theorising, the story was this.</p>

<p>Soon after eleven on the night before, Miss Laura
Hoode had entered her brother’s study and found
him lying, dead and mutilated, on the hearth. Exactly
what the wounds were, Mr. Syme could not say;
but by common report they were sufficiently horrible.</p>

<p>Before she fainted, Miss Hoode screamed. When
other members of the household arrived they found
her lying across her brother’s body. A search-party
was at once instituted for possible murderers, and the
police and a doctor notified. People were saying—Mr.
Syme became confidential—that Miss Hoode’s
mind had been unhinged by the shock. Nothing was
yet known as to the identity of the criminal, but (here
Mr. Syme gave vent to many a dark suggestion,
implicating in turn every member of the household save
his daughter).</p>

<p>Anthony dammed the flow with a question. “Can
you tell me,” he asked, “exactly who’s living in the
house?”</p>

<p>Mr. Syme grew voluble at once. Oh, yes. He
knew all right. At the present moment there were
Miss Hoode, two friends of the late Mr. Hoode’s,
and the servants and the young gent—Mr. Deacon—what
had been the corpse’s secretary. The names?
Oh, yes, he could give the names all right. Servants—his
daughter Elsie, housemaid; Mabel Smith, another
housemaid; Martha Forrest, the cook; Lily Ingram,
kitchen-maid; Annie Holt, parlour-maid; old Mr.
Poole, the butler; Bob Belford, the other man-servant.
Then there was Tom Diggle, the gardener, though
he’d been in the cottage hospital for the last week
and wasn’t out yet. And there was the chauffeur,
Harry Wright. Of course, though, now he came to
think of it, the gardener and the chauffeur didn’t
rightly <em>live</em> in the house, they shared the lodge.</p>

<p>“And the two guests?” said Anthony. It is hard
to believe, but he had assimilated that stream of
names, had even correctly assigned to each the status
and duties of its owner.</p>

<p>“One gent, and one lady, sir. Oh, and there’s the
lady’s own maid, sir. Girl with some Frenchy name.
Duboise, would it be?” Mr. Syme was patently proud
of his infallibility. “Mrs. Mainwaring the lady’s
called—she’s a tall, ’andsome lady with goldy-like
sort of ’air, sir. And the gent’s Sir Arthur
Digby-Coates—and a very pleasant gent he is, sir, so Elsie
says.”</p>

<p>Anthony gave a start of pleasure. Digby-Coates
was an acquaintance of his private-secretarial days.
Digby-Coates might be useful. Hastings hadn’t told
him.</p>

<p>“There be Habbotshall, sir,” said Mr. Syme.</p>

<p>Anthony looked up. On his left—they had been
walking with the little Marle on their right—was a
well-groomed, smiling garden, whose flower-beds,
paths, pergolas, and lawns stretched up to the feet
of one of the strangest houses within his memory.</p>

<p>For it was low and rambling and shaped like a
capital L pushed over on its side. Mainly, it was two
stories high, but on the extreme end of the right
arm of the recumbent L there had been built an
additional floor. This gave it a gay, elfin humpiness
that attracted Anthony strangely. Many-hued clouds
of creeper spread in beautiful disorder from ground
to half-hidden chimney-stacks. Through the leaves
peeped leaded windows, as a wood-fairy might spy
through her hair at the woodcutter’s son who was
really a prince. A flagged walk bordered by a low
yew hedge ran before the house; up to this led a
flight of stone steps from the lower level of the lawns.
Opposite the head of the steps was a verandah.</p>

<p>“This here, sir,” explained Mr. Syme
unnecessarily, “is rightly the back of the ’ouse.”</p>

<p>Anthony gave him his congé and a five-pound
note, hinting that his own presence at Marling should
not be used as a fount for bar-room gossip. Mr.
Syme walked away with a gait quaintly combining the
stealth of a conspirator and the alertness of a great
detective.</p>

<p>Anthony turned in at the little gate and made for
the house. At the head of the steps before the
verandah he paused. Voices came to his ear. The
tone of the louder induced him to walk away from
the verandah and along the house to his right. He
halted by the first ground-floor window and listened,
peering into the room.</p>

<p>Inside stood two men, one a little, round-shouldered,
black-coated fellow with a dead-white face and hands
that twisted nervously; the other tall, burly,
crimson-faced, fierce-moustached, clad in police blue with the
three stripes of a sergeant on his arm.</p>

<p>It was the policeman’s voice that had attracted
Anthony’s attention. Now it was raised again, more
loudly than before.</p>

<p>“You know a blasted sight more o’ this crime than
you says,” it roared.</p>

<p>The other quivered, lifted a shaking hand to his
mouth, and cast a hunted look round the room.
He seemed, thought Anthony, remarkably like a
ferret.</p>

<p>“I don’t, sergeant. Re-really I d-don’t,” he
stammered.</p>

<p>The sergeant thrust his great face down into that
of his victim. “I don’t believe you this mornin’ any
more’n I did last night,” he bellowed. “Now,
Belford, me lad, you confess! If you ’olds out against
Jack ’Iggins you’ll be sorry.”</p>

<p>Anthony leaned his arms on the window-sill and
thrust head and shoulders into the room.</p>

<p>“Now, sergeant,” he said, “this sort of thing’ll never
do, you know.”</p>

<p>The effect of his intrusion tickled pleasantly his
sense of the dramatic. Law and Order recovered
first, advanced, big with rage, to the window and
demanded what was the meaning of the unprintable
intrusion.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Anthony, “shall we call it a wish to
study at close quarters the methods of the County
Constabulary.”</p>

<p>“Who the—— ——ing ’ell are you?” The face of
Sergeant Higgins was black with wrath.</p>

<p>“I,” said Anthony, “am Hawkshaw, the detective!”</p>

<p>Before another roar could break from outraged
officialdom, the door of the room opened. A
thick-set, middle-aged man of a grocerish air inquired
briskly what was the trouble here.</p>

<p>Sergeant Higgins became on the instant a meek
subordinate. “I—I didn’t know you were—were
about, sir.” He stood stiff at attention. “Just
questioning of a few witnesses, I was, sir. This
er—gentleman”—he nodded in the direction of
Anthony—“just pushed his ’ead——”</p>

<p>But Superintendent Boyd of the C.I.D. was shaking
the interloper by the hand. He had recognised the
head and shoulders as those of Colonel Gethryn. In
1917 he had been “lent” to Colonel Gethryn in
connection with a great and secret “round-up” in and
about London. For Colonel Gethryn Superintendent
Boyd had liking and a deep respect.</p>

<p>“Well, well, sir,” he said, beaming. “Fancy seeing
you. They didn’t tell me you were staying here.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” Anthony said. Then added, seeing the
look of bewilderment: “I don’t quite know what I
am, Boyd. You may have to turn me away. I think
I’d better see Miss Hoode before I commit myself any
further.”</p>

<p>He swung his long legs into the room, patted the
doubtful Boyd on the shoulder, sauntered to the door,
opened it and passed through. Turning to his right,
he collided sharply with another man. A person
this, of between forty and fifty, dressed tastefully in
light gray; broad-shouldered, virile, with a kindly face
marked with lines of fatigue and mental stress.
Anthony recoiled from the shock of the collision. The
other stared.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You exaggerate, Sir Arthur,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Digby-Coates recovered himself. “The
most amazing coincidence that ever happened,
Gethryn,” he said. “I was just thinking of you.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Anthony was surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. I suppose you’ve heard? You must
have. Poor Hoode!”</p>

<p>“Of course. That’s why I’m here.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you’d left——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Anthony, “I’ve left the Service.
Quite a time ago. I’m here because—look here,
this’ll sound rot if I try to explain in a hurry. Can
we go and sit somewhere where we can talk?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my boy, certainly. I’m very glad indeed
to see you, Gethryn. Very glad. This is a terrible, an
awful affair—and, well, I think we could do with your
help. You see, I feel responsible for seeing that <em>everything’s</em>
done that can be. It may seem strange to you,
Gethryn, the way I’m taking charge like this; but John
and I were—well ever since we were children we’ve
been more like brothers than most real ones. I don’t
think a week’s passed, except once or twice, that we
haven’t seen—— This way: we can talk better in my
room. I’ve got a sitting-room of my own here, you
know. Dear old John——”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>It was three-quarters of an hour before Anthony
descended the stairs; but in that time much had been
decided and arranged. So much, in fact, that Anthony
marvelled at his luck—a form of mental exercise
unusual in him. He was always inclined to take the gifts
of the gods as his due.</p>

<p>But this was different. Everything was being made
so easy for him. First, here was dear, stolid old Boyd
in charge of the case. Next, there was Sir Arthur.
As yet they were the merest acquaintances, but the
knight had, he knew, for some time been aware of and
impressed by the war record of A. R. Gethryn, and
had welcomed him to the stricken household. Through
Sir Arthur, Miss Hoode—whom Anthony had not
seen yet—had been persuaded to accept Anthony,
despite his present aura of journalism.</p>

<p>Oh, most undoubtedly, everything was going
very well! Now, thought Anthony, for the murderer.
This, in spite of its painful side, was all vastly
entertaining. Who killed Cock Robin Hoode?</p>

<p>Anthony felt more content than for the last year.
It appeared that, after all, there might be interest in
life.</p>

<p>In the hall he found Boyd; with him Poole, the
butler—a lean, shaking old man—and a burly fellow whom
Anthony knew for another of Scotland Yard’s Big
Four.</p>

<p>Boyd came to meet him. The burly one picked up
his hat and sought the front door. The butler
vanished.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d tell me, colonel,” Boyd asked, “exactly
where you come in on this business?”</p>

<p>Anthony smiled. “It’s no use, Boyd. I’m not the
murderer, But lend me your ears and I’ll explain my
presence.”</p>

<p>As the explanation ended, Boyd’s heavy face broke
into a smile. He showed none of the chagrin
commonly attributed to police detectives when faced with
the amateur who is to prove them fools at every turn.</p>

<p>“There’s no one I’d rather have with me, colonel,”
he said. “Of course, it’s all very unofficial——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Boyd. Before I left town I rang
up Mr. Lucas. He gave me his blessing, and told me
to carry on—provided I was accepted by the family.”</p>

<p>Boyd looked relieved. “That makes everything quite
easy, then. I don’t mind telling you that this is a
regular puzzler, Colonel Gethryn.”</p>

<p>“So I have gathered,” Anthony said. “By the way,
Boyd, do drop that ‘Colonel,’ there’s a good Inspector.
If you love me, call me mister, call me mister, Boydie
dear.”</p>

<p>Boyd laughed. He found Anthony refreshingly
unofficial. “Very well, sir. Now, if we may, let’s get
down to business. I suppose you’ve heard roughly
what happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Much detail?”</p>

<p>“A wealth. None germane.”</p>

<p>Boyd was pleased. He knew this laconic mood of
Anthony’s; it meant business. He was pleased because
at present he felt himself out of his depth in the case.
He produced from his breast-pocket a notebook.</p>

<p>“Here are some notes I’ve made, sir,” he said.
“You won’t be able to read ’em, so let me give you an
edited version.”</p>

<p>“Do. But let’s sit down first.”</p>

<p>They did so, on a small couch before the great
fireplace.</p>

<p>Boyd began his tale. “I’ve questioned every one in
the house except Miss Hoode,” he said. “I’ll tackle her
when she’s better, probably this afternoon. But
beyond the fact that she was the first one to see the body,
I don’t think she’ll be much use. Now the facts.
After supp—dinner, that is, last night, Mr. Hoode, Miss
Hoode, Mrs. Mainwaring and Sir Arthur Digby-Coates
played bridge in the drawing-room. They
finished the meal at eight-thirty, began the cards at nine
and finished the game at about ten. Miss Hoode then
said good-night and went to her bedroom; so did the
other lady. Sir Arthur went to his own sitting-room
to work, and the deceased retired to his study for the
same purpose.”</p>

<p>“No originality!” said Anthony plaintively. “It’s
all exactly the same. Ever read detective stories,
Boyd? They’re always killed in their studies.
Always! Ever notice that?”</p>

<p>Boyd—perhaps a little shocked by the apparent
levity—only shook his head. He went on: “That’s the
study door over there, sir, the only door on the right
side of the hall, you see. That little room just
opposite to it—the one you climbed into this morning—is
a sort of den for that old boy Poole, the butler.
Poole says that from about nine-forty-five until the
murder was discovered he sat in there, reading and
thinking. <em>And</em> he had the door open all the time.
<em>And</em> he was facing the door. <em>And</em> he swears that no
one entered the study by that door during the whole
of that time.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Poole is most convenient,” murmured Anthony.
He was lying back, his legs stretched out before him.</p>

<p>Boyd looked at him curiously. But the thin face
was in shadow, and the greenish eyes were veiled by
their lids. A silence fell.</p>

<p>Anthony broke it. “Going to arrest Poole just
yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>Boyd smiled. “No, sir. I suppose you’re thinking
Poole knows too much. Got his story too pat, so to
speak.”</p>

<p>“Something of the sort. Never mind, though. On
with the tale, my Boyd.”</p>

<p>“No, Poole’s not my man. By all accounts he was
devoted to his master. That’s one thing. Another
is that his right arm’s practically useless with
rheumatism and that he’s infirm—with an absolute minimum
of physical strength, so to speak. That proves he’s
not the man, even if other things were against him,
which they’re not. You’ll know why when I take you
into that room there, sir.” The detective nodded his
head in the direction of the study door.</p>

<p>“Well,” he continued, “taking Poole, for the
present at any rate, as a reliable witness, we know that
the murderer didn’t enter by the door. The chimney’s
impossible because it’s too small and the register’s
down; so he must have got in through the
window.”</p>

<p>“Which of how many?” Anthony asked, still in that
sleepy tone.</p>

<p>“The one farthest from the door and facing the
garden, sir. The room’s got windows on all three
sides—three on the garden side, one in the end wall,
and two facing the drive; but only one of ’em—the
one I said—was open.”</p>

<p>Anthony opened his eyes. “But how sultry!” he
complained.</p>

<p>“I know, sir. That’s what I thought. And in this
hot weather and all. But there’s an explanation. The
deceased always had them—those windows—shut all
day in the hot weather, and the blinds down. He
knew a thing or two, you see. But he always used to
open ’em himself at night, when he went in there to
work. I suppose last night he must ’ave been in a
great hurry or something, and only opened one of
’em.” He looked across at Anthony for approval of
his reasoning, then continued: “But the queer thing
is, sir, that that open window shows no traces of
anything—no scratches, no marks, no nothing. Nor does
the flower-bed under it either.”</p>

<p>“Any finger-prints anywhere on anything?” said
Anthony.</p>

<p>“None anywhere in the room but the deceased’s—except
on one thing. I’ve sent that up to the Yard—Jardine’s
taken it—for the experts to photograph.
I’ll have the prints sometime this afternoon I should
think.” Boyd’s tone was mysterious.</p>

<p>Anthony looked at him. “Out with it, Boyd.
You’re like a boy with a surprise for daddy.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, sir,” Boyd laughed, rather
shamefacedly, “it’s the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i>, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve found the ber-loodstained weapon.
Boyd, I congratulate you. What was it? And whose
are the finger-prints?”</p>

<p>“The weapon used, sir, was a large wood-rasp, and
a very nasty weapon it must have made. As for the
finger-prints, I don’t know yet. And it’s my firm
belief we shan’t be much wiser when we’ve got the
enlargements—not even if we were to compare ’em with
all the prints of all the fingers for miles round. I
don’t know what it is, sir, but this case has got a
nasty, puzzling sort of feel about it, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“A wood-rasp, eh?” mused Anthony. “Not very
enlightening. Doesn’t belong to the house, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“As far as I can find out, sir, most certainly not.”
Boyd’s tone was gloomy.</p>

<p>“H’mm! Well, let us advance. We’ve absolved the
aged Poole; but what about the rest of the household?”
Anthony spread out his long fingers and ticked off each
name as he spoke. “Miss Hoode, Mrs. Mainwaring,
her maid Duboise, Sir Arthur, Elsie Syme, Mabel
Smith, Maggie—no, Martha Forrest, Lily Ingram,
Annie Holt, Belford, Harry Wright. Any of them
do? The horticultural Mr. Diggle’s in hospital and
therefore out of it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Boyd stared amazement. “Good Lord, sir!” he
exclaimed, “you’ve got ’em off pat enough. Have you
been talking to them?”</p>

<p>“Preserve absolute calm, Boyd; I have not been
talking to them. I got their dreadful names from an
outsider. Anyhow, what about them?”</p>

<p>Boyd shook his head. “Nothing, sir.”</p>

<p>“All got confused but trustworthy alibis? That it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, more or less; some of the alibis are clear
as glass. To tell you the truth, I don’t suspect any
one in the house. Some of the servants have got
‘confused alibis’ as you call it, but they’re all obviously all
right. That’s the servants; it’s the same only more
so with the others. Take the secretary, Mr. Deacon;
he was up there in his room the whole time. There’s
one, p’r’aps two witnesses to prove it. The same with
Miss Hoode. And the other lady; to be sure she’s got
no witnesses, but that murder wasn’t her job, nor any
woman’s. Take Sir Arthur, it’s the same thing again.
Even if there was anything suspicious—which there
wasn’t—about his relations with the deceased, you
can’t suspect a man who was, to the actual knowledge
of five or six witnesses who saw him, sitting upstairs
in his room during the only possible time when the
murder can have been done.</p>

<p>“No, sir!” Boyd shook his head with vigour. “It’s
no good looking in the house. Take it from me.”</p>

<p>“I will, Boyd; for the present anyhow.” Anthony
rose and stretched himself. “Can I see the study?”</p>

<p>Boyd jumped up with alacrity. “You can, sir.
We’ve been in there a lot, taking photos, etcetera; but
it’s untouched—just as it was when they found the
body.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch04">

<h2>Chapter IV. <br/> The Study</h2>

<p>Once across the threshold of the dead minister’s
study, Anthony experienced a change of feeling,
of mental attitude. Until now he had looked at the
whole business in his usual detached and semi-satirical
way; the reasons for his presence at Abbotshall had
been two only—affection for Spencer Hastings and
desire to satisfy that insistent craving for some definite
and difficult task to perform. He had even felt, at
intervals throughout the morning, a wish to laugh.</p>

<p>But, now, fairly in the room, this aloofness failed
him. It was not that he felt any sudden surge of
personal regret. It was rather that, for him at least,
despite the sunlight which blazed incongruously in
every corner, some cold, dark beastliness brooded
everywhere.</p>

<p>The big room was gay with chintz and as yet
unfaded flowers of the day before; the solid furniture was
of some beauty—in fact, a charming room. Yet
Anthony shivered even before he had seen the thing
lying grotesque upon the hearth. When he did see it,
somehow the sight shook him out of the nightmare of
dark fancy. He stepped forward to look more closely.</p>

<p>Came the sound of a commotion from the hall.
With a muttered excuse, Boyd went quickly from the
room. Anthony knelt to examine the body.</p>

<p>It sprawled upon the hearth-rug, legs towards the
window in the opposite wall. The red-tiled edge of
the open grate forced up the neck. The almost
hairless head was dreadfully battered; crossed and
recrossed by five or six gaping gashes, each nearly half
an inch wide and an inch or so deep. Of the scalp
little remained but islands and peninsulas of skin and
bone streaked with the dark brown of dried blood,
among it ribands of gray film where the brain had
oozed from the wounds.</p>

<p>The body was untouched, though the clothes were
rumpled and twisted. The right arm was outstretched,
the rigid fingers of the hand resting among the pots of
fern which filled the fireplace. The left arm was
doubled under the body.</p>

<p>Anthony, having gazed his fill, rose to his feet. As
he did so, Boyd re-entered. He looked flushed and
not a little annoyed.</p>

<p>Anthony turned to him, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Only a bit more trouble with some of these
newspaper fellows, sir. But thank the Lord, I’ve got rid
of ’em now. Told ’em I’d give ’em a statement
to-night. What they’d say if they knew you were
here—and why—God knows. There’ll be a row after
the case is over, but there you are. Miss Hoode’s
agreeable to you, and I don’t blame her, but she won’t
hear of any of the others being let in. I don’t blame
her for that either.” He nodded towards the body.
“What d’you make of it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Shocking messy kill,” Anthony said.</p>

<p>“You’re right, sir, But what about—things in
general, so to speak?”</p>

<p>Anthony looked round the room. It bore traces of
disturbance. Two light chairs had been over-turned.
Books and papers from the desk strewed the floor.
The grandfather clock, which should have stood
sentinel on the left of the door as one entered it, had fallen,
though not completely. It lay face-downwards at an
angle of some forty-five degrees with the floor, the
upper half of its casing supported by the back of a large
sofa.</p>

<p>“Struggle?” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Boyd.</p>

<p>“Queer struggle,” said Anthony. He sauntered off
on a tour of the room.</p>

<p>Boyd watched him curiously as he halted before the
sofa, dropped on one knee, and peered up at the face
of the reclining clock.</p>

<p>He looked up at Boyd. “Stopped at ten-forty-five.
That make the murder fit in with the times the people
in the house have told you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“When are you going to have the room tidied?”</p>

<p>“Any time now. We’ve got the photos.”</p>

<p>“Right.” Anthony got to his feet. “Let us, Boyd,
unite our strength and put grand-dad on his feet.”</p>

<p>Between them they raised the clock. Anthony
opened the case and set the pendulum swinging. A
steady tick-tock began at once.</p>

<p>Anthony looked at his watch. “Stopped exactly
twelve hours ago, did grandfather,” he said. “Doesn’t
seem to be damaged, though.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. It takes a lot to put those old clocks out of
order.”</p>

<p>Anthony went back to the front of the sofa and
stood looking down at the carpet.</p>

<p>“No finger-prints, you said?”</p>

<p>“Except on the wood-rasp, absolutely none but those
of the deceased, sir. I’ve dusted nearly every inch of
the room with white or black. All I got for my pains
were four good prints of the deceased’s thumb and
forefinger. They’re easy enough to tell—very
queer-shaped fingers and a long scar on the ball of his right
thumb.”</p>

<p>Anthony changed the subject. “What time did you
get here, Boyd?”</p>

<p>“About four this morning. We came by car. I
made some preliminary inquiries, questioned some of
the people, and went down to the village at about eight.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that great red hulk of a sergeant?” said
Anthony, flitting to yet another subject. “You ought
to watch him, Boyd. When I came along he was
indulging in a little third degree.”</p>

<p>“I heard it, sir. That’s why I came in.”</p>

<p>“Good. Who was the timid little ferret?”</p>

<p>“Belford—Robert Belford, sir. He’s a sort of
assistant to Poole and was valet to the deceased.”</p>

<p>“How did he answer when you questioned him?”</p>

<p>“Very confused he was. But his story’s all right—very
reasonable. I don’t consider him, so to speak.
He hasn’t got the nerve, or the strength.”</p>

<p>Anthony stroked his chin. “It’s easy enough to
see,” he said, “that you don’t want to be persuaded
away from your idea that an outsider did this job.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, sir,” Boyd smiled. “As far as I’ve
progressed yet an outsider’s my fancy. Most
decidedly. Still one never knows where the next
turning’s going to lead to, so to speak. Of course, I’ve got
a lot of inquiries afoot—but so far we’ve less than
nothing to go on.”</p>

<p>“Anything stolen?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>Anthony was still gazing down at the carpet before
the sofa. Again he dropped on one knee. This time
he rubbed at the thick pile with his fingers. He rose,
darting a look round the room.</p>

<p>“What’s up, sir?” Boyd was watching attentively.</p>

<p>“A most convenient struggle that,” murmured
Anthony.</p>

<p>“What’s that? What d’you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“I was remarking, O Boyd, that the struggle had
been, for the murderer, of an almost incredible
convenience. Observe that the two chairs which were
overturned are far from heavy; observe also that the
carpet is very far from thin. These light chairs fell,
not, mark you, on the parquet edging of the floor, but
conveniently inwards upon this thickest of thick carpets.
Observe also, most <i lang="fr">puissant</i> inspector, that the articles
dislodged from the writing-table, besides falling on the
carpet, are nothing but light books and papers.
Nothing heavy, you see. Nothing which would make a
noise.”</p>

<p>“I follow you, sir,” Boyd cried. “You mean——”</p>

<p>“ ’Ush, ’ush, I will ’ave ’ush! I would finally direct
your attention to the highly convenient juxtaposition
of this sofa here and our friend the clock. The sofa
is a solid, stolid lump of a sofa; it’s none of your
trifling divans. In fact, it would require not merely
a sudden jerk but a steady and lusty pull to move it,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>The detective applied his considerable weight to the
arm of the sofa. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>“You see!” continued Anthony with a gesture.
“See you also then the almost magical convenience with
which, in the course of the struggle, this lumping sofa
was moved back towards grandfather, who stood nearly
three feet from the sofa’s usual position, which position
can be ascertained by noting these four deep dents
made in the carpet by the castors. Oh, it’s all so
convenient. The sofa’s moved back, then grandfather
falls, not with a loud crash to the floor, but quietly,
softly, on to the back of the sofa. Further, those two
vases on that table there beside the clock weren’t upset
at all by the upheaval. Those vases wobble when one
walks across the room, Boyd. No, it won’t do; it
won’t do at all.”</p>

<p>“You’re saying there wasn’t any struggle at all; that
the scene was set, so to speak.” Boyd’s tone was eager.
His little gray eyes were alight with interest.</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. “Your inference is right.”</p>

<p>“I had explained things to myself by saying that the
carpet was thick and old Poole rather deaf,” said the
detective, “because he did say that he heard a noise like
some one walking about. Of course, he just thought it
was his master. I’ll wager it wasn’t, though. I’m
sure you’re right, sir. I hadn’t noticed the sofa had
been shifted. This is a very queer case, sir, very
queer!”</p>

<p>“It is, or anyhow it feels like that. What about the
body, Boyd? Aren’t you going to have it moved?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, any time now. It was going to be moved
before you came; then Jardine wanted to take some
more photos. After that, you being here, sir—well, I
thought if you <em>were</em> going to have anything to do with
the case you might like to see everything in <i lang="la">status quo</i>,
so to speak.”</p>

<p>Anthony smiled. “Thanks, Boyd,” he said.
“You’re a good chap, you know. This isn’t the first
job we’ve done together by any means; but all the same,
it’s most refreshing to find you devoid of the pro’s
righteous distrust of the amateur.”</p>

<p>Boyd smiled grimly. “Oh, I’ve got that all right,
sir. But I don’t regard you in that light, if I may say
so, though we may disagree before this case is over.
And—well, sir, I’ve not forgotten what you did for me
that night down at Sohlke’s place in Limehouse——”</p>

<p>“Drop it, man, drop it,” Anthony groaned.</p>

<p>Boyd laughed. “Very well, sir. Now I’ll go and
see about having the body moved upstairs.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Anthony, “shall think—here or in the
garden. By the way, when’s the inquest?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow afternoon, here,” said Boyd, and left
the room.</p>

<p>Anthony ruminated. This study of Hoode’s, he
reflected, was curious, being in itself the end of the
long wing of the house and having, therefore, window
or windows in all three sides. As Boyd had said, only
one of these windows was open, the farthest from the
door of the three which looked out upon the terraced
gardens and the river at their foot. All the others—two
in the same wall, one in the end wall, and two
overlooking the drive—were shut and latched on the inside.
The open one was open top and bottom.</p>

<p>Anthony looked at it, then back at the writing-table.
He seemed dissatisfied, for he next walked to the
window, surveyed the room from there, and then crossed to
the swivel-chair at the writing-table and sat down.
From here he again peered at the open window, which
was then in front of him and slightly to his left.</p>

<p>He was still in the chair when Boyd came back,
bringing with him a policeman in plain clothes and a
man in the leather uniform of a chauffeur. Anthony
did not move; did not answer when Boyd spoke to him.</p>

<p>The body covered and lifted, the grim little party,
Boyd leading, made for the door. As they steered
carefully through it, the grandfather clock began to
strike the hour. Its deep ring had, it seemed to
Anthony, a note ominous and mournful.</p>

<p>The door clicked to behind the men and the shrouded
thing they carried. The clock struck again.</p>

<p>“Good for you, grandfather,” muttered Anthony,
without turning in his chair to look. “I wish to High
Heaven you could talk for a moment or two.”</p>

<p>“Bong!” went the clock again.</p>

<p>Anthony pulled out his watch. The hands stood at
eleven o’clock. “All right, grand-dad,” he said. “You
needn’t say any more. I know the time. I wish you
could tell me what happened last night instead of
being so damned musical.”</p>

<p>The clock went on striking. Anthony wandered to
the door, paused, and went back to the writing-table.
As he sat down again the clock chimed its final stroke.</p>

<p>He felt a vague discomfort, shook it off and
continued his scrutiny of the table. It was of some age,
and beautiful in spite of its solidity. The red leather
covering of its top had upon it many a stain of wear
and inks. Yet one of these stains seemed to Anthony
to differ from the general air of the others. He
rubbed it with his fingers. It was raised and faintly
sticky. It was at the back of the flat part of the
table-top. Immediately behind it rose two tiers of drawers
and pigeon-holes. Also, its length was bisected by a
crack in the wood.</p>

<p>He rubbed at the stain again; then cursed aloud.
That vague sense of something wrong in the room,
something which did not fit the essential sanity of
life, had returned to his head and spoilt these new
thoughts.</p>

<p>The door opened and shut. “What’s the matter, sir?
Puzzled?” Boyd came and stood behind him.</p>

<p>“Yes, dammit!” Anthony swung round impatiently.
“This room’s getting on my nerves. Either there’s
something <em>wrong</em> in it or I’ve got complex fan-tods.
Never mind that, though. Boyd, I think I’m going to
give you still more proof that there was no struggle.
Come here.”</p>

<p>Boyd came eagerly. Anthony twisted round to face
the table again.</p>

<p>“Attend! The body was found over there by the
fireplace. If one accepts as true the indications that
a struggle took place, the natural inference is that
Hoode was overpowered and struck down where he was
found. But we have found certain signs that lead us
to believe that the struggle was, in fact, no struggle at
all, and here, I think, is another which will also show
that Hoode’s body was dragged over to the hearth after
he had been killed.”</p>

<p>Boyd grew excited. “How d’you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“This is what I mean.” Anthony pointed to the
stain he had been examining. “Look at this mark here,
where my finger is. Doesn’t it look different to the
others?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say that it does to me, sir. I had a look
over that table myself and saw nothing out of the
ordinary run.”</p>

<p>“Well, I beg to differ. It not only looks different,
it feels different. I notice these things. I’m <em>so</em>
psychic, you know!”</p>

<p>Boyd grinned at the chaff, watching with keen
interest as Anthony opened a penknife and inserted
the blade in the lock of the table’s middle drawer.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Anthony, “that this is one of those
old jump locks. Aha! it is.” He pulled open the
drawer. “Now, <em>was</em> that stain different? Voilà!
It was.”</p>

<p>Boyd peered over Anthony’s shoulder. The drawer
was a long one, reaching the whole width of the
table. In it were notebooks, pencils, half-used
scribbling pads, and, at the back, a pile of notepaper and
envelopes.</p>

<p>On the white surface of the topmost envelope of
the pile was a dark, brownish-red patch of the size,
perhaps, of a half-crown. Boyd examined it eagerly.</p>

<p>“You’re right, sir!” he cried. “It’s blood right
enough. I see what you were going to say. This
is hardly dry. It must have dripped through that
crack where the stain you pointed out was. And the
position of that stain is just where the deceased’s head
would have fallen if he had been sitting in this chair
here and had been hit from behind.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Anthony. “And after the first of
those pats on the head Hoode must’ve been unconscious—if
not dead. Ergo, if he received the first blow
sitting here, as this proves he did, there was no
struggle. One doesn’t sit down at one’s desk to
resist a man one thinks is going to kill one, does one?
What probably happened is that the murderer—who
was never suspected to be such by Hoode—got
behind him as he sat here, struck one or all of the blows,
and then dragged the body over to the hearth to lend
a touch of naturalness to the scene of strife he was
going to prepare. He must be a clever devil, Boyd.
There’s never a stain on the carpet between here and
the fireplace. There wouldn’t have been on the table
either, only he didn’t happen to spot it.”</p>

<p>The detective nodded. “I agree with you entirely,
sir.”</p>

<p>But Anthony did not hear him. That <em>wrong</em> something
was troubling him again. He clutched his head,
trying vainly to fix the cause of this feeling.</p>

<p>Boyd tried again. “Well, we know a little more
now, sir, anyhow. Quite a case for premeditation, so
to speak—thanks to you.”</p>

<p>Anthony brought himself back to earth. “Yes,
yes,” he said. “But hearken again, Boyd. I have
yet more to say. Don’t wince, I have really. Here
it is. Assuming the reliability, as a witness, of Poole,
the old retainer, we know the murderer didn’t come
into this room through the door. Nor could he, as
you’ve explained, have used the chimney. Remains
the one window that was open. Observe, O Boyd,
that that window is in full view of a man seated at
this table. Now one cannot come through a window
into a room at a distance of about two yards from a
man seated therein at a table without attracting the
attention of that man unless that man is asleep.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think Hoode was asleep, sir.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. It is known that Hoode was a hard
worker. Further, if I’m not mistaken, he’s been more
than usually busy just recently—over the new Angora
Agreement. I think we can take it for granted he
wasn’t asleep when the murderer came in through
that window. That leads us to something of real
importance, namely, that Hoode was not surprised by
the entry of the murderer.”</p>

<p>Boyd scratched his head. “ ’Fraid I don’t quite get
you, as the Yanks say, sir.”</p>

<p>Anthony looked at him with benevolence. “To
make myself clearer, I’ll put it like this: he either
(i) expected the murderer—though not, of course, as
such—and expected him to enter that way; or (ii) did
not expect him to enter that way, but on looking up
in surprise saw some one who, though he had entered
in that unfamiliar way, was yet so familiar in himself
as not to cause Hoode to remain long, if at all, out
of his seat. Personally, I think he didn’t leave his
chair at all. Is not all this well spoken, Boyd?”</p>

<p>“True enough, sir. I think you’re quite right
again. I’ve been a fool.” Boyd was dejected. “Of
the two views you propounded, so to speak, I think
the first’s the right one. The murderer was an
outsider, but one the deceased was expecting—and by that
entrance.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Anthony, “incline strongly toward
my second theory of the unconventional entry of the
familiar.”</p>

<p>Boyd shook his head. “You’d hardly credit it,
sir,” he said solemnly, “but some of these big men
get up to very funny games. I’ve had over twenty
years in the C.I.D., and I know.”</p>

<p>“The mistake you’re making in this case, Boyd,”
Anthony said, “is thinking of it as like all your others.
From what little I’ve seen so far of this affair it’s
much more like a novel than real life, which is mostly
dull and hardly ever true. As I asked you before,
d’you ever read real detective stories? Gaboriau, for
instance?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no, sir!” smiled the real detective.</p>

<p>“You should.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir, but you’re a knock-out at this
game yourself and it makes me wonder, so to speak,
how you can hold with all that ’tec-tale truck.”</p>

<p>“A knock-out? Me?” Anthony laughed. “And
I feel as futile as if I were Sherlock Holmes trying
to solve a case of Lecoq’s.” He put a hand to his
head. “There’s something about this room that’s
haunting me! What is the damned thing? Boyd,
there’s something <em>wrong</em> about the blasted place, I
tell you!”</p>

<p>Boyd looked bewildered. “I don’t know what you
mean, sir.” Then, to humour this eccentric, he
added: “Ah! if only this furniture could tell us what
it saw last night.”</p>

<p>“I said that to the clock,” said Anthony morosely,
Then suddenly: “The clock, the clock! Grandpa
<em>did</em> tell me something! I knew I’d seen or heard
something that was utterly wrong, insane. The
clock! Good God Almighty! What a fool not to
think of it before!”</p>

<p>Boyd became alarmed. His tone was soothing.
“What about the clock, sir?”</p>

<p>“It struck. D’you remember it beginning when you
were taking the body away?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Boyd was all mystification.</p>

<p>“What time was that?”</p>

<p>“Why, eleven, of course, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was, my uncanny Scot. But grandfather
said twelve. I was thinking about something else.
I must have counted the strokes unconsciously.”</p>

<p>“But—but—are you <em>sure</em> it struck twelve when”—Boyd
glanced up at the old clock—“when it said
eleven?”</p>

<p>Anthony crossed the room, opened the glass casing
of the clock-face, and moved the hands on fifteen
minutes. They stood then at twelve.</p>

<p>“Bong!” went the clock.</p>

<p>They waited. It did not strike again.</p>

<p>Anthony was triumphant. “There you are, Boyd!
Grandpa looks twelve and says one. There’s another
strand of that rope you’re making for the murderer.
Miss Hoode came in here at eleven-ten, to find the
murder done and the murderer gone. You’re time’s
almost fixed for you. He wasn’t here at eleven-ten,
but he was here after eleven, because, to put the
striking of that clock out as it is, the murderer must
have put back the hands after the hour—eleven, that
is—had struck. If he’d done it before the striking had
begun, grand-dad wouldn’t be telling lies the way
he is.”</p>

<p>Boyd’s expression was a mixture of elation and
doubt. “I suppose that’s right, sir,” he said. “About
the striking, I mean. Yes, of course it is; just for
the moment I was a bit confused, so to speak.
Couldn’t work out which way the mistake would
come.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Anthony, “that the whole
reason he faked this elaborate struggle scene was in
order that the clock could be stopped under what
would seem natural circumstances. But why, having
stopped the clock, did he alter it? Two reasons occur
to me. One is that he merely wished to make it
seem that the murder was done at any other time
except when it really was. That’s rather weak, and
I prefer my second idea. That is, that the time to
which he moved the hands has a significance and
wasn’t merely a chance shot. In other words, he set
the thing at ten-forty-five because he had a nice clean
alibi for that time. Judging by the rest of his work
he’s a man of brains; and that would’ve been a pretty
little safeguard—if only he hadn’t made that mistake
about the striking.”</p>

<p>“They all make bloomers—one time or another,
sir. That’s how we catch ’em in the main.”</p>

<p>“I know.” Anthony’s tone was less sure than a
moment before. “All the same it’s a damn’ silly
mistake. Doesn’t seem to fit in somehow. I’d
expected better things from him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, sir. He’d probably got the
wind up, as they say, by the time he’d got so near
finishing.”</p>

<p>Anthony shrugged. “Yes, I suppose you’re right.
By the way, Boyd, tell me this. How did Miss Hoode
come to be downstairs at ten past eleven? I thought
she was supposed to have gone to bye-bye after that
game of cards.”</p>

<p>“As far as I know—I haven’t been able to see
her yet, sir—she came down to use the telephone—not
this one but the one in the hall—about some minor
affair she’d forgotten during the day. After she’d
finished phoning she must’ve wanted to speak to her
brother. Probably about the same matter. That’s
all, sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s so weak,” said Anthony, “that it might
possibly be true.” Then, after a pause: “I think I’ve
had about enough of this tomb. What you going to
do next, Boyd? I’m for the garden.” He walked to
the door. “You took the weaker end of my reasoning
if you still believe in the mysterious outsider.”</p>

<p>Boyd followed across the hall, through the verandah
and down the steps which led from the flagged walk
behind the house to the lawns below.</p>

<p>Anthony sat himself down upon a wooden seat set
in the shade of a great tree. He showed little
inclination for argument.</p>

<p>But Boyd was stubborn. “You know, sir,” he said,
“you’re wrong in what you say about the ‘insider.’
You’d agree with me if you’d been here long enough
to sift what evidence there is and been able the way
I have to see <em>and</em> talk to all the people instead of
hearing about them sketchy and second-hand as it
were.”</p>

<p>Anthony looked at him. “There’s certainly
something in that, Boyd. But it’ll take a lot to shift me.
Mind you, my predilection for the ‘insider’ isn’t a
conviction. But it’s my fancy—and strong.”</p>

<p>Boyd fumbled in his breast-pocket. “Then you
just take a good look at this, sir.” He held out some
folded sheets of foolscap. “I made that out before
you got here this morning. It’ll tell you better what
I mean than I can talking. And I only sketched the
thing to you before.”</p>

<p>Anthony unfolded the sheet, and read:—</p>

<p class="headline">Summary of Information Elicited</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><b>Miss Laura Hoode</b>.—Played cards until 10
o’clock with the deceased, Sir A. D.-C., and Mrs.
Mainwaring. Then went to bed. Was seen in
bed at approximately 10.30 by Annie Holt,
parlour-maid, who was called into room to take
some order as she passed on her way to the
servants’ quarters. Miss Hoode remembered, at
about 11.05, urgent telephone call to be made.
Got up, went downstairs to phone, then thought
she would consult deceased first. Entered study,
at 11.10, and discovered body. [<i>Note.</i>—By no
means a complete alibi; but it seems quite out of
the question that this lady is in any way concerned.
She is distraught at brother’s death and was
known to be a devoted sister. They were, as
always, the best of friends during day.]</p>

<p><i>N.B.—It appears impossible for a woman to have
committed this crime, since the necessary power
to inflict blows such as caused death of deceased
would be that of an unusually strong man.</i></p>

</li>
<li>

<p><b>Mrs. R. Mainwaring</b>.—Retired at same time as
Miss Hoode. Was seen in bed by her maid, Elsie
Duboise, at 10.35. Was waked out of heavy
sleep by parlour-maid, Annie Holt, after discovery
of body of deceased.</p>

</li>
<li>

<b>Elsie Duboise</b>.—This girl sleeps in room
communicating with Mrs. Mainwaring’s. The night
was hot and the door between the two rooms was
left open. Mrs. Mainwaring heard the girl get
into bed at about 10.40. The parlour-maid had
to shake her repeatedly before she woke.

</li>
<li>

<b>Sir A. Digby-Coates</b>.—Went upstairs, after cards,
to own sitting-room (first-floor, adjoining
bedroom) to work at official papers. Pinned note on
door asking not to be disturbed, but had to leave
door open owing to heat. Was seen, from
passage, between time he entered room until time
murder was discovered, at intervals averaging a very
few minutes by Martha Forrest (cook), Annie
Holt (parlour-maid), R. Belford (man-servant),
Elsie Duboise, Mabel Smith (housemaid), and
Elsie Syme (housemaid). The time during which
the murder must have been committed is covered.

</li>
<li>

<b>Mr. A. B. T. Deacon</b> (Private Secretary to
deceased).—Went to room (adjoining that of Sir
A. D.-C.) to read at approximately 10.10. Was
seen entering by Mabel Smith, who was working
in linen-room immediately opposite. She had
had afternoon off and was consequently very
busy. Stayed there till immediately (say two
minutes) before murder was discovered. She
can swear Mr. Deacon never left room the whole
time, having had to leave door of linen-room
open owing to heat.

</li>
<li>

<b>Women Servants</b>.—These are Elsie Syme,
Mabel Smith, Martha Forrest, Annie Holt, Lily
Ingram. All except the first two account for
each other over the vital times, having been in
the servants’ quarters (in which the rooms are
inter-communicating ) from 10.15 or so onwards.
Elsie Syme, who was downstairs in the servants’
hall until the murder was discovered, and Mabel
Smith, may be disregarded. They have no one
to substantiate their statements, but there is no
doubt at all that they are ordinary, foolish, honest
working-girls. (See also note after details re
Miss Hoode.)

</li>
<li>

<b>Alfred Poole</b> (Butler)—Has not a shred of
alibi. Was seated, as usual, in his den opposite
study all the evening. After 10 spoke to no one;
was seen by nobody. May, however, be disregarded
as in any way connected with murder.
Will be very useful witness. May (in my
opinion) be trusted implicitly. Not very intelligent.
Very old, infirm, but sufficiently capable
to answer questions truthfully and clearly. [Has,
for one point, nothing like half strength murderer
must have used.] Was devoted to deceased,
whose family he has served for forty-one years.

</li>
<li>

<b>Robert Belford</b> (man-servant).—Has certain
support for his own account of his actions; but
not enough probably for fuller test. Nothing
against him, and last man in world for crime of
this type. Might possibly poison, but has neither
courage nor strength enough to have murdered
deceased. Seems nervous. <em>May</em> know more than
he admits, but unlikely.

</li>
<li>

<b>Other Men-servants</b>.—Harry Wright, chauffeur,
and Thomas Diggle, gardener. Both not concerned.
Diggle is in hospital. Wright, who lives
in the lodge by the big gates, was off last
night and with reputable friends in Marling
village. He did not return until some time after
murder had been discovered. The three lads
who work under Diggle live in their homes in the
village. All were at home from eight o’clock
onwards last night.

<p>Anthony, having reached the end, read through the
document again, more slowly this time. Boyd watched
him eagerly. At last the papers were handed back to
their owner.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he said. “See what I mean?”</p>

<p>“I do, Boyd, I do. But that doesn’t necessarily
mean I agree, you know.”</p>

<p>Boyd’s face fell. “Ah, sir, I know what it is.
You’re wondering at an old hand like me trying to
prove to you that nobody in the house could’ve done it,
when all the time most of ’em haven’t got what you
might call sound alibis at all. But look here, sir——”</p>

<p>Anthony got to his feet. “Boyd, you wrong me!
I like your guesses even better than your proofs.
Guesses are nearly always as good as arithmetic—especially
guesses by one of your experience. I didn’t
say I didn’t agree with you, did I?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t <em>say</em> so, sir, so to speak!”</p>

<p>“Nor I didn’t mean it either.” Anthony laughed.
“My mind’s open, Boyd, open. Anyhow, many thanks
for letting me see that. I know a lot more detail than
I did. I suppose that’s a basis for a preliminary
report, what?”</p>

<p>Boyd nodded, and fell into step as Anthony turned
in the direction of the house.</p>

<h2>Chapter V. <br/> The Lady of the Sandal</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Anthony was still in the garden. Anthony had
found something. Clouds of pipe-smoke hung
round his head in the hot, still air. Anthony was
thinking.</p>

<p>He was alone. Boyd, indefatigable, had gone at
once into the house, bent upon another orgy of shrewd
questioning. This time his questions would have, in
the light of what the study had told, a more definite
bearing.</p>

<p>What Anthony had found were two sets, some
eighteen inches apart, of four deep, round
impressions of roughly the size of a sixpence. They were
in the broad flower-bed which ran the whole length
of the study wall and were directly beneath the sill
of the most easterly of the three windows—the farther
closed window, that is, from the open one through
which it seemed that the murderer must have effected
entrance to the study. The flower-bed; Anthony
noticed, was unusually broad—so broad, in fact, that
any person, unless he were a giant, wishing to climb
into any of the three windows, would perforce tread,
with one foot at least, among the flowers.</p>

<p>He stooped to examine his find. Whoever, in the
absence of Mr. Diggle the gardener, had so lavishly
watered the flower-bed on the previous day received
his blessing. Had the soil not been so moist, those
holes would not have been there.</p>

<p>Anthony thought aloud: “Finger-holes. Just
where my fingers would go if I was a good deal
narrower across the shoulders and squatted here and
tried to look into the room without bringing either
of my feet on to the bed.”</p>

<p>He stepped deliberately on to the flower-bed and
bent to examine the low sill of the window. There
was a smudge on the rough stone. It might be a
dried smear of earthy fingers. On the other hand,
it might be almost anything else. But as he
straightened his back a bluish-black gleam caught his eye.</p>

<p>He investigated, and found, hanging from a crevice
in the rough edge of the sill, a woman’s hair. It was
a long hair, and jet black.</p>

<p>“That explains the closeness of those finger-marks,”
he muttered. “A woman in the case, eh? Now,
why was she here, in front of the closed window?
And was she here last night? Or this morning,
quite innocent like? The odds are it was last night.
One doesn’t crouch outside a Cabinet Minister’s
window in daylight. Nor at all, unless one’s up to
no good. No, I think you were here last night, my
black beauty. I love little pussy, her hair is so
black, and if I don’t catch her she’ll never come back.
Now where did you come from, Blackie dear? And
have you left any other cards? O, Shades of Doyle!
What a game!”</p>

<p>He stepped back on to the path and knelt to
examine the stone edging to the flower-bed. In the
position she must have been in, the woman would
most probably, he argued, have been on one knee and
had the foot of the other leg pressed vertically against
this edging.</p>

<p>She had; but Anthony was doubly surprised at
what he found. For why, in this dry weather, should
the mark of her foot be there at all? And, as it was
there, why should it look like a finger-print a hundred
times enlarged?</p>

<p>He scratched his head. This was indeed a crazy
business. Perhaps he was off the rails. Still, he’d
better go on. This all <em>might</em> have something to do
with the case.</p>

<p>More closely he examined this footprint that was
like a finger-print. Now he understood. The mark
had remained because the peculiar sole of this peculiar
shoe had been wet and earthy. There had been no
rain for a week. Why was the shoe wet? And why—he
looked carefully about—were there no other such
marks on the flagstones of the path? Ah, yes; that
would be because in ordinary walking or running the
peculiar shoes did not press hard enough to leave
anything but a wet patch which would quickly dry.
Whereas, in pressing the sole of the foot against that
edging to the flower-bed, much more force would have
to be used to retain balance—sufficient force to squeeze
wet clayish earth out in a pattern from that peculiar
sole.</p>

<p>But what about the wetness? He hadn’t settled
that. Suddenly his mind connected the peculiarity of
that imprint with the idea of water. A rope-soled
sandal. When used? Why, bathing. Here Anthony
laughed aloud. “Sleuth, you surpass yourself!” he
murmured. “Minister murdered by Bathing Belle—only
not at the seaside! Cock Robin’s murderer not
Sparrow as at first believed, but one W. Wagtail!
Gethryn, you’re fatuous. Take to crochet.”</p>

<p>He started for the verandah door. Half-way he
stopped, suddenly. He’d forgotten the river. But
the idea was ridiculous. But, after all—well, he’d
spend ten minutes on it, anyhow. Now, to begin—assuming
that the woman <em>had</em> come out of the river
and had wanted (strange creature!) to get back there—he
would work out her most probable route and follow
it. If within five minutes he had found no more
signs of her, he’d stop.</p>

<p>After a moment’s calculation he started off, going
through the opening in the yew hedge, down the grass
bank to his right and then crossing the rose garden at
whose far side there began a pergola.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the pergola he found, caught
round a thorny stem of the rose-creeper that fell from
the first cross-piece of the archway, four long black
hairs.</p>

<p>Anthony controlled his elation. These might not,
he thought, be from the same head. But all the same
it was encouraging. It fitted well. Running in the
dark and a panic, she hadn’t ducked low enough. He
could see her tearing to free her hair. Well, he’d
get on. But really this mad idea about swimming
women <em>couldn’t</em> be true.</p>

<p>From the other end of the pergola he emerged on
to a lawn, its centre marked by a small but active
fountain. A gravelled path, along which he
remembered having walked up to the house, ran down at the
right of the grass to the gate on the river-bank through
which he had entered. He paused to consider the
position; then decided that one making in a hurry for
the gate would cut across the grass.</p>

<p>He found confirmation. Round the fountain’s
inadequate basin was a circle of wet grass, its deep
green in refreshing contrast to the faded colour of
the rest. At the edge of the emerald oasis were two
indistinct imprints of the sandal and its fellow, and
two long smeared scars where the grass had been torn
up to expose the soil beneath. Farther on, but still
within the circle, were two deeper, round impressions;
beyond them, just where the wet grass ended, was
another long smear.</p>

<p>Anthony diagnosed a slip, a stagger, and a fall.
Not looking for more signs—he had enough—he
hurried on to the little gate. The other side of it,
on the path which ran alongside the blustering pigmy
of a river, he hesitated, looking about him. Again he
felt doubt. Was it likely that any one would swim
the Marle at night? Most decidedly it was not. In
the first place there was, only some three hundred and
fifty yards or so downstream to his right, a perfectly
good bridge, which joined the two halves of the
village of Marling. In the second place, the Marle,
though here a bare twenty yards wide, seemed as
uncomfortable a swim as could well be, even for a
man. Always turbulent, it was at present actually
dangerous, still swollen as it was by the months of heavy
rain which had preceded this record-breaking August.</p>

<p>“No!” said Anthony aloud. “I’m mad, that’s what
it is. But then those <em>are</em> bathing sandals. <em>And</em> didn’t
I just now tell Boyd he was making a mistake in not
treating this business like the goriest of ’tec tales?”</p>

<p>He stood looking over the river. If only he could
fit any sort of reason——</p>

<p>One came to him. He laughed at it; but it intrigued
him. It intrigued him vastly. There was a house,
just one house, on the opposite bank. It was perhaps
thirty yards higher up the stream than the gate by
which he was standing.</p>

<p>Suppose someone from that house wanted to get to
Abbotshall quickly, so quickly that they could not
afford to travel the quarter-mile on each side of the
river which crossing by the bridge would involve.
Taking that as an hypothesis, he had a reason for this
Captain Webb business. The theory was insane, of
course, but why not let fancy lead him a while?</p>

<p>The very fact that the woman was so good a
swimmer as she must be, made it probable that she
would be sufficiently water-wise to make use of, rather
than battle helplessly against, the eight-mile-an-hour
stream. Very well, then, before taking to the river,
on her way back she would have run upstream along
this bank to a point some way above the house she
wished to return to on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Still laughing at himself, Anthony turned to his
left and walked upstream, his eyes on the soft clay at
the river’s edge. When he had passed by fifty yards
the house on the other side, he found two sandal-marks.
They were deep; the clay gave a perfect impression.</p>

<p>He was surprised but still unbelieving. Then, as
he stood for a moment looking down into the dark
water only a few inches below the level of his feet,
a gleam of white caught his eye. Curious, he squatted,
pulled up his sleeve and thrust his arm into the water,
groping about the ledge which jutted out from the
bank some inches below the surface. His fingers
found what they sought. He rose to his feet and
examined his catch.</p>

<p>A small canvas bathing-sandal. From its uppers
dangled a broken piece of tape. The sole was of
rope.</p>

<p>“Benjamin,” said Anthony to his pipe, “I’m right.
And I’ve never been so surprised in my life. It looks
to <em>me</em>, my lad, as if A. R. Gethryn <em>may</em> have been
wrong and Brother Boyd right. Where’s my ‘insider’
now?”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Anthony had crossed the river. Behind him lay
Marling’s wooden bridge, before him the house which
must shelter the swimming lady. In his hip-pocket
rested the sandal, wrung free of some of its wetness
and wrapped in a piece of newspaper found by the
hedge.</p>

<p>He walked slowly, framing pretexts for gaining
admission to the house. His thoughts were
interrupted by a hail. He swung round to see Sir Arthur
Digby-Coates coming at a fast walk from the direction
of the bridge.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur arrived out of breath. “Hallo, my
boy, hallo,” he gasped. “What are you doing here?
Calling on Lucia? Didn’t know you knew her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. Lucia who?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lemesurier. That’s her house there. Just
going there myself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk along to the gate with you,” said Anthony.
He saw a possible invitation. He began to make
talk. “I wasn’t going anywhere; just strolling. I
wanted to get away from Abbotshall and think. After
I left the study, I drifted through the garden and
crossed the river without knowing I’d done it.” Not
even to Sir Arthur was he saying anything yet of his
discoveries.</p>

<p>The elder man picked his remarks up eagerly.
“You’ve hit on something to think about, then?
That’s more than I’ve done, though I’ve been racking
my brains since midnight. That detective fellow
don’t seem much better off either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Boyd’s a very good man,” Anthony said. “He
generally gets somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so.” Sir Arthur sighed. “This is a
terrible business, Gethryn. Terrible! I can’t talk
much about it yet—poor old John. Did you know him
at all?”</p>

<p>“No. Shook hands with him once at some feed,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You’d have liked him, Gethryn. He—we’d best
not talk about it. God! What an outcry there’ll be—is
already, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Anthony. “A blow to England and a
boon to Fleet Street. Look here, don’t let me keep you.
I hope Mrs.—Mrs. Lemesurier appreciates the beauty
of her house.”</p>

<p>“Charming, isn’t it? Gleason built it, you know.”
He paused, and Anthony feared his bait unswallowed.
They had arrived at the gate to the garden. Over the
hedge showed lawns, flowers, and the house. Anthony
had not been merely diplomatic when he had praised
its beauty. It was a building in the best modern
manner and in its way as good to look upon as Abbotshall.</p>

<p>Anthony made as if to leave.</p>

<p>But Sir Arthur had swallowed the bait. “Look here,
Gethryn,” he said; “why not come in with me? The
inside’s more worth seeing than the out. And I’d like
you to meet Lucia and her sister. They’d be glad to
see you too. They were expecting another to lunch
besides me—young Deacon, John’s secretary. He
wouldn’t come. He’s very busy, and being young, I
suppose he feels it’d be a sin to enjoy himself in any
way to-day. Silly, but I like him for it. He don’t
know the necessity yet for doing anything to keep
sane.” He laid a hand on Anthony’s arm. “Do come
along.”</p>

<p>Anthony allowed himself to be persuaded. They
walked through the garden and then round the house
to the front door. They were shown by a cool,
delightful maid to a cool, delightful drawing-room.</p>

<p>Through the French-window, which opened on to
the garden they had approached by, there burst a girl.
Anthony noted slim ankles, a slight figure, and a pretty
enough face. But he was disappointed. The hair was
of a deep reddish-gold.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur presented Mr. Anthony Gethryn—he
knew of Anthony’s dislike of the “Colonel”—to Miss
Dora Masterson.</p>

<p>The girl turned to the man she knew. “But—but
where’s Archie? Isn’t he coming, too?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur’s face lost its conventional smile. “No,
my dear. I’m afraid he’s not. He—he’s very busy.”
He hesitated. “You will have heard—about Mr.
Hoode?”</p>

<p>The girl caught her breath. “Yes. But only just
now. You must think it awful of me not to have
asked you at once; but—but I hardly believed it. It
wasn’t in any of the papers we had this morning. And
I’ve only just got up; I was so tired yesterday.
Travers, the parlour-maid, told me. Loo doesn’t know
yet. I think she’s got up—or only just; she stayed in
bed this morning too.” The girl grew agitated.
“Why are you looking like that? Has—is Archie in—in
trouble?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur laughed, and then grew grave again.
“Lord, no, child! It’s only that he’s busy. You see,
there are detectives and—and things to see to. I’m
rather a deserter, I suppose, but I thought I’d better
come along and bring Mr. Gethryn with me. He
arrived this morning, very fortunately. He’s helping
the police, being—well, a most useful person to have
about.” He paused. Anthony, to conceal his
annoyance at this innocent betrayal, became engrossed in
examination of a water-colour of some merit.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur continued: “It is a terrible tragedy, my
dear——”</p>

<p>“What! What is it?” came a cry from the doorway
behind them.</p>

<p>The voice would have been soft, golden, save for that
harsh note of terror or hysteria.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur and the girl Dora whipped round.
Anthony turned more slowly. What he saw he will never
forget.</p>

<p>“A woman tall and most superbly dark,” he said to
himself later. Tall she was, though not so tall as her
carriage made her seem. And dark she was, but with
the splendour of a flame: dark with something of a
Latin darkness. Night-black hair dressed simply,
almost severely, but with art; great eyes that seemed,
though they were not, even darker than the hair; a
scarlet, passionate mouth in which, for all its present
grimness, Anthony could discern humour and a
gracious sensuality; and a body which fulfilled the promise
of the face. Anthony looked his fill.</p>

<p>Dora was beside her. “Loo darling! Lucia!” she
was saying. “It—it’s terrible, but—but it’s nothing to
do with us. What’s upset you so? What’s the matter,
darling?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur came forward. Simply, straightforwardly,
he told of Hoode’s death. “It’s an awful
blow for me,” he concluded, “but I wouldn’t have
frightened you for worlds, Lucia.”</p>

<p>From where he stood discreetly in the background,
Anthony saw a pale half-smile flit across her face.
She was seated now, the young sister hovering
solicitous about her, but he noted the tension of all the
muscles that preceded that smile.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know what made me so—so foolish,”
she said. And this time her voice, that golden voice,
was under control. Anthony was strangely moved.</p>

<p>She became suddenly aware of the presence of a
stranger. Anthony was presented. The touch of her
hand sent a thrill up his arm and thence through his
body, a thrill which first sent the blood madly to his
head and then left him pale. He kept his face from
the light. He reproached himself for possessing, in
the thirties, the sudden emotions of sixteen.</p>

<p>The two sisters withdrew. Lunch, they said, would
be ready in five minutes.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur dropped into a chair and looked across
at Anthony with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>“A little overwrought,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Yes. She can’t be well. Most unusual for
Lucia to be anything but mistress of herself. Expect
she was feeling cheap and then got scared by my
sepulchral voice.” He fell silent for a moment; then
a smile broke across the tired sadness of his face.
“Well, what impression has she made on you,
Gethryn?”</p>

<p>“My feelings,” Anthony said, “are concerned with
Mr. Lemesurier. I wonder is he worthy of his luck?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur smiled again. “You’ll have a job to
find out, my boy. Jack Lemesurier’s been dead for
four years.”</p>

<p>A gong announced lunch. At the foot of the
stairs Mrs. Lemesurier encountered her sister.</p>

<p>Dora was still solicitous. “Feeling better, Loo
darling?” she asked.</p>

<p>Lucia grasped her sister’s arm. “Dot, who—who
was that man with Sir Arthur?” Her voice rose.
“Who is he? Dot, tell me!”</p>

<p>Dora looked up in amazement. “What <em>is</em> the matter,
dear? I’ve never known you behave like this before.”</p>

<p>Lucia leant against the balusters. “I—I don’t know
exactly. I—I’m not feeling well. And then this—this
murder——” Again she clutched at her sister’s
arm. “Dot, you must tell me! They say Mr. Hoode
was killed last night. But how? Who—who shot
him?”</p>

<p>The door of the drawing-room opened behind her.
Anthony emerged. His poker-playing is still famous;
not a sign did he give of having heard the last remark
of his hostess.</p>

<p>But he admired her courage, the way she took
command of herself, almost as much as her beauty.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>If that lunch was a success it was due to Anthony
Gethryn. Until he came to the rescue there was an
alternation of small-talk and silence so uncomfortable
as to destroy the savour of good food and better
wine. Sir Arthur was sinking deep into the toils of
sorrow—one could see it—Miss Masterson was anxious
about her sister and her absent lover, and the hostess
was plainly discomposed.</p>

<p>So Anthony took command. The situation suited
him well enough. He talked without stint. Against
their desire he interested them. It must be believed
that he had what is known as “a way with him.”
Soon he extorted questions, questions which he turned
to discussion. From discussion to smiles was an
easy step. Sir Arthur’s face lost some of its gloom.
Dora frankly beamed.</p>

<p>Only the woman at the head of the table remained
aloof. Anthony took covert glances at her. He could
not help it. Her pallor made him uncomfortable.
He blamed himself. He saw that she was keeping
herself under an iron control, and fell to wondering,
as he talked to the others, how much more beautiful
she would be were this fear or anxiety lifted from her
shoulders.</p>

<p>But was she beautiful? He stole another look,
purely analytical. No, she was not: not, at least,
if beauty were merely perfection of feature. The
eyes were too far apart. The mouth was too big.
No, she was better than beautiful. She was herself,
and therefore——</p>

<p>Anthony reproved himself for the recurrence of
these adolescent emotions. His thoughts took a
grimmer turn. He thought of that spongelike mess that
had been a man’s head. It was time he got to work.</p>

<p>He slid into another story. The silence which fell
was flattering. It was a good story. Whether it was
true is no matter.</p>

<p>It was a tale of Constantinople, which Anthony
knew as his listeners knew London. He had, it
seemed, been there, almost penniless, in nineteen
hundred and twelve. It was a tale of A Prosperous
Merchant, A Secret Service Man, A Flower of the
Harem, and A Globe-Trotter. Its ramifications were
amusing, thrilling, pathetic, and it was at all times
enthralling. Its conclusion was sad, for the Flower
of the Harem was drowned. She could not swim the
distance she had set herself. And the Secret Service
Man went back to his Secret Service Duties.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur cleared his throat. Dora Masterson’s
eyes held tears. At the head of the table her sister
sat rigid, her white hands gripping the arms of her
chair. Anthony noted her attitude with quickened
pulse: she had shown no interest until the end of the
story.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, “she was a little fool to try
it. Think of the distance. And the tide was strong.
It’d be impossible even for an athletic Englishwoman.”
He is to be congratulated upon making so ridiculous
a statement in so natural a tone.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Gethryn, surely not,” cried Dora
excitedly. “Why Loo——”</p>

<p>A spurt of flame and a crash of breaking china
interrupted her sentence. Mrs. Lemesurier had
overturned spirit-lamp and coffee-pot. Much damage had
resulted to cups and saucers. The tablecloth was
burning.</p>

<p>“Not bad at all,” thought Anthony, as he rose
to help. “But you won’t get off quite so easily.”</p>

<p>Order was restored; fresh coffee made and drunk.
The party moved to the drawing-room and thence to
garden.</p>

<p>Anthony lingered in the pleasant room before
joining the others on the lawn.</p>

<p>At last he took a seat beside his hostess. The
deck-chairs were in the shade of one of the three great
cedars.</p>

<p>“A delightful room, your drawing-room, if I may
say so.” His tone was harmlessly affable.</p>

<p>The reply was icy. “I am glad it pleases you,
Mr.—Mr. Gethryn.”</p>

<p>Anthony beamed. “Yes, charming, charming. It
has an air, a grace only too rare nowadays. I
admired that sideboard thing immensely; Chippendale,
I think. And how the silver of those cups shows up
the polish of the wood!”</p>

<p>With this speech he did not get the effect for which
he had wished. Beyond a pulse in the white throat
that leapt into startled throbbing, there was no sign
of alarm. She remained silent.</p>

<p>Half his mind applauded her and reviled himself.</p>

<p>But the other half, ruthless, urged him on. “Have
another try; you must,” it whispered. “Get to the
bottom of this business. Don’t behave like a
schoolboy!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I was so interested that I had to
examine those cups and their inscriptions,” he
murmured. “Very rude of me. But to have won all
those! You must be a wonderful swimmer, Mrs.
Lemesurier.”</p>

<p>The little pulse in her throat beat heavily. “I have
given it up—long ago,” she said simply. Her eyes—those
eyes—looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>Anthony spurred himself. “Of course,” he said,
smiling, “there’s no opportunity for pleasure
swimming about here, is there? Except the Marle. And
one would hardly tackle that for pleasure, what?
The motive would have to be sterner than that.”</p>

<p>The blood surged to the pale face, and then as
suddenly left it. Anthony was seized with remorse.
His mind hunted wildly for words to ease the strain,
but he could find none. The sandal in his pocket
seemed to be scorching his flesh.</p>

<p>She rose slowly to her feet, crossed to where her
sister sat with Sir Arthur some yards away, said
something in a low voice, and walked slowly across
the grass towards the house. Though Anthony could
see that she only attained movement by a great effort
of will, the grace of her carriage gave him a swift
sensation—half pleasure, half pain—which was like
a clutch at his throat. The clinging yellow gown she
wore seemed a golden mist about her.</p>

<p>He turned to join the other two, deep in conversation.
A little cry came to their ears. They swung
round to see a limp body sink huddled to the gravel
of the path before the windows of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Anthony reached her side before the girl or the elder
man had moved. As they came up,</p>

<p>“Dead faint,” he said. “Nothing to be frightened
about, Miss Masterson. Shall I carry her in?” He
waved a hand towards the open French-windows.</p>

<p>“Oh, please do.” Dora picked nervously at her
dress. “It—it <em>is</em> only a faint, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She was reassured. Anthony gathered the still body
in his arms and bore it into the room.</p>

<p>He withdrew to the background while Sir Arthur
and the girl ministered. Had he wished he could not
have helped them. He had held Her in his arms.
His heart hammered at his ribs. He felt—though
he would not have acknowledged it—actually giddy.
Only by an effort did he manage to mask his face with
its usual impassivity. His one desire for the moment
was to get away and think; to leave this house before
he did more harm. Reason; thought; his sense of
justice—all deserted him.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur stepped back from the couch. Colour
had come back to the cheeks of the woman. The lids
of the eyes had flickered. Sir Arthur turned.</p>

<p>Anthony touched him on the arm. “I think we’re
superfluous, you know,” he said.</p>

<p>The other nodded. “You’re right. I’ve told Dora
I’d send a doctor, but she doesn’t seem to think it’s
necessary. Come on.”</p>

<p>They slipped from the room, and in two minutes
were walking back along the river-bank towards the
bridge.</p>

<h2>Chapter VI. <br/> The Secretary and the Sister</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>They had walked for perhaps two hundred yards
before the elder man broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I hope Lucia will be all right,” he said.
“Probably it was the heat. It’s a scorcher to-day.”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. He was in no mood for talk.</p>

<p>“Dora was telling me,” continued Sir Arthur,
“that Lucia had been feeling queer since last night.
They hardly saw her after dinner. She vanished to
her room and locked herself in. But apparently she’d
been all right this morning until lunch-time.”</p>

<p>Anthony began to take notice. Here was more
confirmation—though it was hardly needed.</p>

<p>They were drawing near the bridge now. Another
silence fell. Again it was Sir Arthur who broke it.</p>

<p>“You’re very silent, my boy,” he said. “Perhaps
you’ve got something to think about, though.
Something definite, I mean.” His tone changed. “God!
What I would give to get my hands on the—the
animal that killed John! I shan’t sleep till he’s
caught. It’s torture he needs! Torture!” The kindly
face was distorted.</p>

<p>Anthony looked at him curiously. “The great
difficulty so far,” he said, “is failure to find any
indication of motive. I mean, you can’t do anything
in a complicated case unless you can do some work
from that end. A motiveless murder’s like a child
without a father—damn’ hard to bring home to any
one. Suppose I suddenly felt that life wouldn’t be
worth living any longer unless I stabbed a fat man in
the stomach; and I accordingly went to Wanstead and
assuaged that craving on the darkest part of the Flats,
and after that took the first train home and went to
bed. They’d never find me out. The fat man and I
would have no connection in the minds of the police.
No, motive’s the key, and so far it’s hidden. Whether
the lock can be picked remains to discover.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur smiled. “You’re a curious feller,
Gethryn. You amuse while you expound.” He grew
grave again. “I quite see what you mean: it’s
difficult, very difficult. And I can’t imagine any one
having a grudge against John.”</p>

<p>Anthony went on: “Another thing; the messiness
of the business indicates madness on the part of the
murderer. With homicidal mania there might be no
motive other than to kill. Myself, I don’t think the
murderer was as mad as all that. Look at the care
he took, for all his untidiness. No, the murderer was
no more mad than the rest of the affair. It’s all
mad if you look at it—in a way. Mad as a Hatter on
the first of April. And so am I, by God!” His
voice trailed off into silence.</p>

<p>They had crossed the bridge now. Sir Arthur,
instead of turning directly to his right to return to
Abbotshall by the riverside path, chose the way which
led to the village. Anthony drifted along beside him
in unheeding silence. He was thinking.</p>

<p>Yes, “mad” had been the right word to use. There
didn’t seem to be any common sense about the thing.
Even She was mad! Why swim to Abbotshall?
The saving in time, he calculated, could have only been
a matter of ten minutes or so. And she couldn’t—well,
she must have been in hell’s own hurry. But
the sandals indicated a bathing-dress, and surely the
time taken to change into that might have been spent
in covering the distance on dry land. And what had
she been there for, outside that window of the study?
She—surely She had nothing to do with that messy
crime—must be interrogated. Oh, yes! His heart
beat faster at the thought of seeing her again.</p>

<p>He rebuked himself for thus early and immorally
losing interest in his task, and returned to
consciousness of his surroundings. He found himself in
Marling High Street.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur disappeared, suddenly, into a low-browed
little shop, whose owner seemed, from his
wares, to be an incongruous combination of grocer,
tobacconist, draper and news-agent. Anthony stood
looking about him. The narrow street, which should
have been drowsing away that blazing August
afternoon, carried an air of tension. Clumps of people
stood about on its cobbles. Women leaned from the
windows of its quaint houses. The shop outside which
he waited, and two others across the road, flaunted
shrieking news placards.</p>

<p>“ ’Orrible Murder of a Cabinet Minister!” Anthony
quoted with a wry face. “Poor devil, poor devil.
He’s made more stir by dying than he ever did in his
life.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur emerged, a packet of tobacco in one
hand, a sheaf of newspapers in the other. With
fleeting amusement Anthony noticed the red and black
cover of an <i>Owl</i> “special.” They walked on.</p>

<p>The elder man glanced down at the papers in his
hand. “It’s a queer thing, Gethryn,” he said, “but
I somehow can’t keep away from the sordid side of this
awful, terrible tragedy. Up at the house I keep feeling
that I must get into that study—that room of all
places! And I came this way really to buy
newspapers, though I cheated myself into thinking it was
tobacco I wanted. And I can’t help nosing about
while the detectives are working. I expect I shall
bother you.” His voice was lowered. “Gethryn, do
you think you’ll succeed? He was my best
friend—I——my nerves are on edge, I’m afraid. I——”</p>

<p>“Great strain.” Anthony was laconic.
Conversation did not appeal to him.</p>

<p>He tried to map out a course of action, and decided
on one thing only. He must see and talk with the
Lady of the Sandal again. For the rest, he did not
know. He must wait.</p>

<p>They walked on to the house in silence. At the
front door was a car. Boyd was climbing into it.
He paused at the sight of Anthony. Sir Arthur
passed into the house.</p>

<p>Boyd was excited, respectably excited. “Where’ve
you been, sir? You’ve missed all the fun.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Anthony was sceptical.</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t mind telling you, sir, that the case
is over, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“Is it now?”</p>

<p>“It is. You were quite right, sir. It was some
one belonging to the house. I can’t tell you more
now. I’m off back to town. I’ll see you later, sir.”</p>

<p>Anthony raised his eyebrows. Things were going
too fast. Had Boyd found out anything about Her?</p>

<p>“Shalt not leave me, Boyd.” He raised a
protesting hand. “ ‘The time has come, the Walrus
said——’ You’re too mysterious. Be lucid, Boyd,
be doosid lucid.”</p>

<p>The detective glanced at his watch with anxiety.
He seemed torn between the call of duty and desire to
be frank with the man who had helped him.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to be very short, then, sir,” he said,
pushing the watch back into his pocket. “Ought to
have started ten minutes ago. This is very unofficial
on my part. I’m afraid I must ask you——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be superfluous, Boyd.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. After I left you in the garden
this morning, I asked them all—the household—some
more questions, and elicited the fact that one of what
you called the ‘cast-iron’ alibis was a dud, so to speak.
It was like this, sir: one of the maids had told me
she’d seen Mr. Deacon—that’s the deceased’s secretary—go
to his room just after ten. That coincided with
what he told me himself, and also with what Sir
Arthur Digby-Coates said. Now, this girl spent the
time from ten until about a minute before the murder
was discovered working—arranging things and what
not, I take it—in the linen-room. Apparently it took
her so long because she’d been behindhand, so to speak,
and was doing two evenings’ jobs in one. This
linen-room’s just opposite Mr. Deacon’s room, and the girl
said last night that she knew he hadn’t come out
because, having the door of this linen-room open all
the time, she couldn’t have helped but see him if he
had.</p>

<p>“But she told a different tale this morning, sir,
when I talked to her after you’d left me. I wasn’t
thinking about Deacon at all, to tell you the truth,
when out she comes with something about having made
a mistake. ‘What’s that?’ I said, and told her not to
be nervous. Then she tells me that she hadn’t been in
the linen-room all that time after all. She’d left it
for about ten minutes to go downstairs. She was
very upset—seemed to think we’d think she was a
criminal for having made a slip in her memory.”
Boyd laughed.</p>

<p>Anthony did not. “What time was this excursion
from the linen-closet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“As near as the girl can remember, it was ten minutes
or so after she saw Deacon go into his room, sir.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose, according to you, that this Deacon
left his room while the girl was away, slipped out of
the house, waited, climbed into the study window,
killed his employer, climbed out again, hid somewhere
till the fuss was over, got back unseen to his room,
and then pretended he hadn’t ever left it.”</p>

<p>Boyd looked reproach. “You’re being sarcastic,
sir, I know; but as a matter of fact that’s very nearly
exactly what he did do.”</p>

<p>“Is it? You know, Boyd, it doesn’t sound at all
right to me.”</p>

<p>“You won’t think that way, sir, when I tell you
that we <em>know</em> Deacon’s our man.” Boyd lowered his
voice. “Colonel Gethryn, those finger-prints on the
weapon—the wood-rasp—are Deacon’s!”</p>

<p>“Are they now?” said Anthony irritably. “How
d’you know? What did you compare ’em with?”</p>

<p>Boyd looked at him almost with pity. “Got every
one’s marks this morning, sir.” He smiled happily.
“Handed each one of ’em—when I was alone with
’em, of course—a bit of white paper. Very mysterious
I was about it too, asking ’em if they recognised it.
They didn’t: very natural when you come to think
each sheet was out of my notebook.” He looked
again at his watch.</p>

<p>“One moment,” said Anthony. “Found anything
like a motive?”</p>

<p>The watch went back into its pocket. “We have,
sir. Yes, you may well look surprised—but we have.
And the motive’s a nice little piece of evidence in
itself. A chance remark Sir Arthur made when I was
talking to him before luncheon-time put me on to it.
Yesterday morning he happened to walk with the
deceased into the village. The deceased went into the
bank, and, luckily, Sir Arthur went in with him. Mr.
Hoode drew out a hundred of the best, so to speak—all
in ten-pound notes. We didn’t know of this before,
because Sir Arthur had mentioned it to the Chief
Constable—Sir Richard Morley—last night, and Sir
Richard had somehow not thought it important enough
information to pass on.” Boyd’s tone conveyed his
opinion of the Chief Constable of the county. “Well,
sir, I had a search made. That hundred was missing.
But we found it!”</p>

<p>Anthony ground his heel savagely into the gravel.</p>

<p>“I suppose it was secreted behind the sliding panel
in Deacon’s room, all according to Cocker?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know anything about any sliding panel, sir;
nor any Mr. Cocker. But Deacon’s room is just
where we did find it. I verified the numbers of the
notes from the bank.”</p>

<p>“What’s Deacon say about it?”</p>

<p>The detective barked scornfully. “Said Mr. Hoode
gave it to him for a birthday present. Lord, a
birthday present! So probable, isn’t it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why the withering irony, Boyd? It’s so
improbable that it’s probably true.”</p>

<p>Boyd snorted. “Now, sir, just think about it!
Turn it over in your mind, so to speak. Deacon’s
alibi turns out all wrong. His movements last night
fit the time of the murder. A hundred pounds drawn
from the bank by the deceased are found stuffed into
a collar-box in Deacon’s room—a good hiding-place,
but not one to put a ‘birthday-present’ in. <em>And</em>, sir,
Deacon’s finger-prints are found on the weapon which
the murder was done with! Why! it’s a case in a
million, so to speak. Wish they were all as easy.”</p>

<p>“All right, Boyd; all right. I’ll admit you’ve
some justification. Yes—I suppose—queer about those
finger-prints! Very queer!”</p>

<p>Boyd smiled. “In fact, they settle the business by
themselves, as you might say.” His kindly face grew
grave. “It’s quite clear, sir, I think. That murder—one
of the worst in my experience—was done for the
sake of a paltry hundred pounds!”</p>

<p>Anthony was not moved. “And your culprit, I
presume,” he said, “languishes in Marling’s jail.”</p>

<p>“If you mean have we arrested Deacon, sir, we
have not. He doesn’t know anything about us having
found the prints of his fingers. And I’m afraid I
must ask you, sir, officially, to say nothing to him
about what I’ve told you. You see, this is one of
those cases where contrary to the general rule we should
like the coroner’s jury to pass a verdict against our
man and then arrest him. I’m having him watched
until the inquest to-morrow, and we’ll nab him after.”
Out came the watch again; a look of horror crossed
its owner’s face. “I must really get off now, sir. I’m
terrible late as it is. Got to report up at the Yard.
Good-day, sir, I’ll see you to-morrow if you’re still
here. And thank you for your help. It was you and
what you said in your study about it being an ‘insider,’
so to speak, that put me on the right track, though
I did take your other view at first. Now I see—as
I’ve done in the past, sir—that you generally know.”</p>

<p>Anthony concealed a smile at this attempt to gild
the pill. “So I put you on the right track, did I?”
he said softly. “Or the wrong, my friend; or the
wrong! I don’t like it. I don’t like it a little bit.
It’s too rule-of-thumb. The Profligate Secretary, the
Missing Bank-Notes, the Finger-printed Blunt
Instrument! It’s not even a good shilling shocker. It’s
too damnation ordinary, that’s what it is!”</p>

<p>If Boyd heard him he gave no sign, but hurried
back to the waiting car.</p>

<p>Anthony watched it out of sight. He communed
with himself. No, he didn’t like it. And where did
She come in? And why, in the name of a name, had
she said: “Who shot him?” when the poor devil had
had his head battered in?</p>

<p>“That rather lets her out as regards the actual
bashing,” he said, half-aloud. “That’s a comfort,
anyhow. But it’s perplexing, very perplexing. ‘Do
I sleep, do I dream, or is Visions about?’ I think,
yes, I think a little talk with the murderous secretary
would do me good—always remembering the official
injunction not to tell him he’s going to be hanged
soon.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Archibald Basil Travers Deacon—his parents have
much to answer for—was in the drawing-room. He
sprawled in an easy-chair beside the open windows. A
book lay face-downwards upon his knees.</p>

<p>Anthony, entering softly, had difficulty in
persuading himself that this was the man he sought. He
had expected the conventional private secretary; he
found a man in the late twenties with the face of a
battered but pleasant prize-fighter, the eyes of a
lawyer, and the body of Heracles.</p>

<p>Anthony coughed. The secretary heaved himself to
his feet. The process took a long time. The
unfolding complete, he looked down upon Anthony’s six feet
from a height superior by five inches. He stretched
out a hand and engulfed Anthony’s. A tremendous
smile split his face.</p>

<p>He boomed softly: “You must be Gethryn.
Heard a lot about you. So you’re here disguised as a
bloodhound, what? Stout fellah!”</p>

<p>They sat, and Anthony produced cigars. When
these were well alight,</p>

<p>“Queer show, this,” said Deacon.</p>

<p>“Very,” Anthony agreed.</p>

<p>Silence fell. Openly they studied each other.
Deacon spoke first.</p>

<p>“Boyd,” he said, settling a cushion behind his great
shoulders, “is quite wrong.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Anthony was startled.</p>

<p>“I remarked, brother, that your Wesleyan-lookin’
detective friend was shinning up the wrong shrub.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Anthony. “How?”</p>

<p>“Your caution, brother, is commendable; but I think
you know what I mean. Chief Detective-Inspector, or
whatever he is, W. B. Boyd of Scotland Yard’s
Criminal Investigation Department—bless his fluffy
little bed-socks—is labourin’ under the delusion that I,
to wit Archibald Etcetera Deacon, am the man who
killed John Hoode. You apprehend me, Stephen?”</p>

<p>Anthony raised his eyebrows. “How much do you
know, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“All depends on your meanin’, If you’re asking
whether I know anything about how the chief was
done in, the answer’s ‘nothing.’ But if you mean how
much do I know of Scotland Yard’s suspicion of me,
that’s a different story.”</p>

<p>“Number two’s right,” said Anthony. “Fire ahead.”</p>

<p>“Comrade Boyd,” said the secretary, “is a tenacious,
an indefatigable old bird, and he’s found out some
funny things. But what he doesn’t see is that they’re
only funny and no more. First, I didn’t contradict
him—very foolish of me, that—when it was obvious
that he thought I’d been in my room last night from
ten until after they found the chief done in in his
study. I didn’t contradict him because the mistake
seemed as if it would get me out of a very
compromising position. You see, at about a quarter-past ten
I left my room, went downstairs, out of the front door,
and enjoyed a cheery stroll on my lonesome. When
I came back I found the whole damn’ place in an
uproar, the murder having been already discovered.
There was such a general shemozzle that nobody
noticed me come in until I got there, what! My—what’s
the officialese for it?—‘suppression of the truth’
gave Boyd clue number one.</p>

<p>“Clue number two was the money. And the money
was what had made me seize on an alibi when it was
handed to me on a plate—the alibi, I mean. You see,
it was so hellish awkward, this money business, and I
let old Bloodhound Boyd fog himself because I wanted
time to think. It was like this: the chief and I really
were very good friends indeed—he was a damn’ good
fellah—though we did growl at each other occasional-like;
and I believe the poor old lad was really attached
to me; anyhow the money made it seem like that. He
was a very canny old Haggis, you know, but he was
subject to fits of extraordinary generosity. I
mentioned some days ago—forget how it came up—that
Wednesday was my birthday. Well, last night, or
rather yesterday afternoon about five—when I took
some papers in to him in the study, he wished me
many happy returns of the day before, apologised for
having forgotten the ceremony, and shoved an envelope
into my mit: in that envelope were ten crisp little
tenners, all nice and new and crumply-lookin’. Of
course I did the hummin’ and haain’ act, but he’d
have none of it.</p>

<p>“ ‘No, my boy,’ he says, ‘you keep it. Must let
an old fellah like me do what I want.’ So I scraped
at the old forelock and salaamed. Thought it was
damned decent of him, you know. As I was clearin’
out, though, he stopped me, coughin’ and hum-hummin’
and lookin’ all embarrassed. ‘Deacon,’ he said,
‘er-um-er-um—don’t you mention that little memento
to—to any one, will you?’ ‘Not if you’d rather I
didn’t, sir,’ says I. He gave a sickly sort of grin
and muttered. But I understood him all right. He
meant his sister. She’s one of those holy terrors that’s
not a bad sort really. I always knew she kept a pretty
Jewish fist on the purse-ropes, though. P’r’aps
that’s why he didn’t give me a cheque.”</p>

<p>Anthony took the cigar from his mouth. “And
Boyd,” he said, “finds out that Hoode had this money
in the house, institutes a search, and finds it in your
collar-box, which looks like an ingenious hiding-place
but was really just an accidental safe. He also finds
out that you weren’t in your room last night during
all the time that you let him think you were, and that
you entered the house—probably by the verandah
door—just after the body was found. He looks at
you and connects your obvious strength with the ruts
in Hoode’s skull. He sees your titanic length of leg
and argues that you’re the only person in the house
likely to be able to step through that open study-window
without marking the flower-bed by treading on
the flowers. He does a sum, and the answer is:
<i>x</i> equals the murderer and Archibald Deacon equals <i>x</i>.
That’s what you know, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You have it all, old thing, all! <i lang="fr">Quel lucidité!</i>”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t,” said Anthony, thinking of the
finger-prints and his promise to Boyd. “There’s more
in it than that, I’m afraid.” He puffed at his cigar.
“By the way, you didn’t do it, did you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Deacon, and laughed.</p>

<p>Anthony smiled. “I shouldn’t have believed you if
you’d said yes. You can’t give me a line, I suppose?
Any private suspicions of your own? I’ve a bag of
data, but nothing to hang it on.”</p>

<p>“The answer, old thing, is a lemon. Nary suspicion.
But what’s all this about data? Found anythin’
fresh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know”—Anthony waved vague hands.
“Possibly yes, possibly no, if you follow me. I mean,
you never can tell.”</p>

<p>Deacon smiled. “Kamerad!” he said. “Served me
right. But that’s me all over, I’m afraid. Damn
nosey! But you must admit I’m an interested party.”</p>

<p>“I do,” Anthony said; then suddenly leaned forward.
“Have you told me <em>all</em> you know?” he asked. “And
are you going to tell me anything you don’t <em>know</em>,
but merely feel?”</p>

<p>Deacon was silent for perhaps a minute. “I can’t
tell you anything more that I <em>know</em>,” he said at last
and slowly. “And as to the other, what exactly are
you driving at? D’you mean: do I definitely suspect
any one as being the murderer?”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. “Just that.”</p>

<p>“Then the answer’s no. But I’ll tell you what I
do feel very strongly, and that’s that it isn’t any one
belonging to the house.”</p>

<p>“So you think that, do you?” said Anthony. “You
know, I’ve heard that before about this affair.”</p>

<p>Deacon sat up. “Oh! And what do <em>you</em> think?
The reverse?”</p>

<p>Anthony shrugged non-committal shoulders.</p>

<p>“But it’s absurd,” said the secretary. “Quite utterly
imposs’, my dear feller!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” Anthony raised his eyebrows. “Ever read
detective stories, Deacon? Good ones, I mean.
Gaboriau, for instance. If you do, you’ll know that
the ‘It’ is very often found among a bunch of ‘unlikely
and impossibles.’ And one of my chief stays in
life is my well-proved theory that Fiction is Truth.
The trouble is that the stories are often more true than
the real thing. And that’s just where one goes wrong,
and sometimes gets left quite as badly off the mark
as the others. I’m beginning to think I may be doing
that here.”</p>

<p>Deacon scratched his head. “I think you’re ahead
of me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Never mind, I’m ahead of myself. A long way
ahead.”</p>

<p>“Well, says I, I hope you catches yourself up soon.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Anthony got to his feet. “Is it possible
for me to see Miss Hoode this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“ ’Fraid not. Our Mr. Boyd saw her this morning,
and she’s given orders that that was enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, I prowl,” said Anthony, and walked to the
door. “By the way, on that walk of yours last night,
that awkward walk, did you meet any one? or even
see any one?”</p>

<p>“No. And that’s awkward, too, isn’t it? Nary
human being did I pass.”</p>

<p>Anthony opened the door. “Any time you think
I’d be useful, let me know,” he said, and passed into
the passage.</p>

<p>Deacon’s voice followed him. “Thanks. When
you’re wanted I’ll make a noise like a murderer.
Stout fellah!”</p>

<p>Walking down the passage which led to the great
square hall, Anthony pondered. It seemed impossible
that this gigantic imperturbability was a murderer.
But how to explain the finger-prints? And Deacon
did not know of those prints. What would he do
when told of them?</p>

<p>“The man’s in a mess,” he said to himself. “This
week’s problem: how to extricate him? The solution
will be published in our next week’s issue—per-haps!”</p>

<p>He came out into the hall. The utter silence of
the house oppressed him. Any sound, he thought,
would be welcome, would make things seem less like
a nightmare.</p>

<p>He turned to his left, making for the verandah
door. His fingers on its handle, he paused. Behind
him, to his right, was the door of the study. His
ears had caught a sound, a rustling sound, from that
direction. He looked about him. No one was near,
in sight even. The two men Boyd had left on duty
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Quietly, he crossed to the study door. He laid his
ear against it. He heard the click of a lock, a light
lock, then a rustle of paper, then soft footsteps.</p>

<p>He crossed the hall to the foot of the stairs in
three jumps. A barometer and a clock hung on the
wall. He studied them.</p>

<p>He heard the study door open, slowly, as if the one
who opened were anxious not to be noisy. Then
came a rustle of skirts. He stepped out from the
shadow.</p>

<p>Half-way between the study and where he stood
by the foot of the stairs was a woman. Her hand,
which had been at the bosom of her dress, fell to her
side.</p>

<p>Anthony moved towards her. Closer, he saw her
more plainly—a tall, square-shouldered grenadier of
a woman, with a sexless, high-cheekboned, long-nosed
face. The features, the sand-coloured hair, were
reminiscent of the dead minister.</p>

<p>“Miss Hoode?” Anthony bowed. “My name is
Gethryn. I believe that Sir Arthur Digby-Coates has
explained my presence.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” The woman’s tones were flat, lifeless as her
face. She essayed cordiality. “Yes, indeed. I told
him I was glad, very glad, to have your help. I need
to apologise for not having spoken to you before,
but—I—but——”</p>

<p>Anthony raised a hand. “Believe me, madam, I
quite understand. I would like, if it is not an
impertinence, to express my condolence.”</p>

<p>The woman bowed her head. “Thank you,” she
said; pressing a hand to her heart. “I—I must leave
you. Give orders for anything you may want.”</p>

<p>Anthony watched her mount the stairs and disappear.
“My good woman—if you really are a woman—what’s
your trouble? Sorrow? Or fear? Or both?” he
thought. “And why were you in the study? And
why were you so secret about it? And above all, what
did you hide in your flat bosom when you saw me?
Two whats and two whys.”</p>

<p>He stood filling his pipe. Assuredly this fresh
mystery must be investigated. And so must that of
the lady that swam rivers in the night and blinded her
pursuer’s eyes and assaulted his heart in the morning.
If it had not been for Her all this would have been
great fun; but now—well, it was anything but
amusing. She must know something, and since Boyd had
seen fit to suspect the one obviously innocent person,
it was Anthony Ruthven Gethryn’s business to find
out what she knew. What was so disturbing was the
unreasonableness of the affair. Nothing seemed to
have motive behind it. Of course, there was reason
for everything—the Lady of the Sandal’s swim over
the river, the secret ravishing of the study by the
bosomless, sexless sister of the corpse, even the
appearance of an innocent man’s finger-prints on the
murderer’s weapon—but were they sane reasons? At
present it seemed as if they could not be, and what
could be more hopeless than the search of a sane man
for the motives of lunatics!</p>

<p>Anthony shook himself, chided and took himself in
hand. “Gethryn,” he murmured, “do something, man!
Don’t stand here saying how difficult everything is.
Well, what shall I do? Have a look at the study?
All right.”</p>

<p>He still had the hall to himself. Quietly, he
entered the study and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>He surveyed the room. He strove for memory of
the sounds he had heard just now when Laura Hoode
had been there and he outside.</p>

<p>There had been a fumbling, a click, a pause and then
the rustling of paper. The writing-table was the most
likely place. The drawers, he knew, were all locked,
but perhaps the gaunt sister had duplicate keys. The
originals were in Boyd’s official possession.</p>

<p>But it was unlikely that sister would have keys. He
looked thoughtfully at the table. Something of a
connoisseur, he judged it as belonging to the adolescence
of the last century.</p>

<p>A desk more than a hundred years old! A mysterious,
sinister woman searching in it! “A hundred to
one on. Secret Drawer!” thought Anthony, and probed
among the pigeon-holes. He met with no success, and
felt cheated. His theory of the essential reality of
story-books had played him false, it seemed.</p>

<p>Loath to let it go, he tried again; this time pulling
out from their sheaths the six small, shallow drawers
which balanced the pigeon-holes on the other side of the
alcove containing the ink-well. The top drawer, he
noticed with joy, was shorter by over an inch than its
five companions. He felt in its recess with long,
sensitive fingers. He felt a thin rim of wood. He
pressed, and nothing happened. He pulled, and it came
easily away. The Great Story-book Theory was
vindicated.</p>

<p>He peered into the unveiled hollow. It was filled
with papers, from their looks recently tossed and
crumpled.</p>

<p>“Naughty, naughty Laura!” said Anthony happily,
and pulled them out.</p>

<p>There were letters, a small leather-covered
memorandum-book, a larger note-book and a bunch of
newspaper-cuttings.</p>

<p>He pulled a chair up to the table and began to read.
When he had finished, he replaced the two little books
and the letters. They were, he judged, unimportant.
The newspaper-cuttings he retained, slipping them into
his wallet. The illegality of the proceeding did not
apparently distress him.</p>

<p>He replaced the little drawers, careful to leave things
as he had found them. On his way to the door, he
paused to examine the little polished rosewood table
which stood beside the grandfather clock and was the
fellow of that which supported the two tall vases he
had spoken of to Boyd. A blemish upon its glossy
surface had caught his eye.</p>

<p>On close inspection he found a faint scar some twelve
inches long and two wide. This scar was compounded
of a series of tiny dents occurring at frequent and
regular intervals along its length and breadth.</p>

<p>Anthony became displeased with himself. He ought
to have noticed this on his first visit to the room. Not
that it seemed important—the wood-rasp had obviously
been laid there, probably by the murderer, possibly by
some one else—but, he ought, he considered, to have
noticed it.</p>

<p>He left the room, passed through the still empty hall
and so into the garden. Here, pacing up and down the
flagged walk outside the study, he became aware of
fatigue. The lack of a night’s sleep and the energies of
the day were having their effect.</p>

<p>To keep himself awake, he walked. He also thought.
Presently he halted and stood glaring at the wall above
the windows of the study. As he glared, he muttered
to himself: “That bit of dead creeper, now. It’s
untidy. Very untidy! And it doesn’t fit!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Sir Arthur found him, heavy-eyed,
hands in pockets, still looking up at the wall,
heavy-eyed, and swaying ever so little on his feet.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Gethryn, hallo!” Sir Arthur looked at him
keenly. “You looked fagged out, my boy. This won’t
do. I prescribe a whisky and soda.” He caught
Anthony’s arm. “Come along.”</p>

<p>Anthony rubbed his eyes. “Well, I grow old, I
grow old,” he said. “Did you say a drink?
Forward!”</p>

<h2>Chapter VII. <br/> The Prejudiced Detective</h2>

<p>Thornton, Mrs. Lemesurier’s parlour-maid,
was enjoying her evening out. To Mrs. Lemesurier
and her sister, drinking their coffee after dinner,
came Thornton’s second-in-command.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am,” she said, “there is a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“What? Who?” Lucia pushed back her chair.</p>

<p>“There is a gentleman, ma’am. In the drawing-room.
He says might he see you. Very important,
he said it was. Please, ma’am, he wouldn’t give no
name.” The girl twisted her apron-strings nervously.</p>

<p>“Shall I go, dear?” Dora asked placidly. Inwardly
she was frightened. She had thought her sister
recovered from her attack of the afternoon, but here
she was getting ill again. White-faced! Nervy!
Not at all like the usual Lucia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lemesurier rose to her feet. “No, no. I’d
better see him. Elsie, what name—oh, you said he
wouldn’t give one. All right. The drawing-room,
you said?” She walked slowly from the room.</p>

<p>Outside the drawing-room door she paused, fought
for composure, gained it, and entered. Anthony came
forward to meet her.</p>

<p>Her hand went to her naked throat. “You!” she
whispered.</p>

<p>Anthony bowed. “You are right, madam.”</p>

<p>“What do you want? What have you come here
for, again?” So low was her voice that he could
barely catch the words.</p>

<p>“You know,” said Anthony, “we’re growing
melodramatic. Please sit down.” He placed a chair.</p>

<p>Mechanically she sank into it, one hand still at the
white throat. The great eyes, wide with fear, never
left his face.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Anthony, “let us clear the atmosphere.
First, please understand that I have no object here
except to serve you. I wasn’t quite clear about that
this morning, hence my clumsy methods. The next
move’s up to you. Suppose you tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>Her eyes fell from his. “All about what? Really,
Mr.—Mr. Gethryn, do you always behave in this
extraordinary way?”</p>

<p>“Good! Quite good!” Anthony approved. “But
it won’t do, you know. It won’t do. I repeat,
suppose you tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>She essayed escape by another way. She looked up
into his face, a light almost tender in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you—do you—really mean that about—about
serving? Is it true that you want to help me?” she
asked. And still her voice was soft; but with how
different a softness!</p>

<p>“Most certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then I assure you, Mr. Gethryn, most honestly
and sincerely, that you will help me best by—by”—she
hovered on the brink of admission—“by not
asking me anything, by not trying any more
to—to——” She broke down. Her voice died away.</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head. “No. You’re wrong,
quite wrong. I’ll show you why. Last night John
Hoode was murdered. During the night you swam
across the river, crept up to the house, and crouched
outside the window of the room in which the murder
was done. Why did you do all this? Certainly not
for amusement or exercise. Then, unless a coincidence
occurred greater than any ever invented by a novelist
in difficulties, your visit was in some way connected
with the murder. Or, at any rate, some of the
circumstances of the murder are known to you.”</p>

<p>“No! No!” Lucia shrank back into her chair.</p>

<p>“There you are, you see.” Anthony made a
gesture. “I was putting the point of view of the police
and public—what they would say if they knew—not
giving my own opinion.</p>

<p>“The sleuth-hounds of fiction,” he went on, “are
divinely impartial. The minions of Scotland Yard
are instructed to be. But I, madam, am that <i lang="la">rarissima
avis</i>, a prejudiced detective. Ever since this case
began I’ve been prejudiced. I’ve been picking up new
prejudices at every corner. And the strongest,
healthiest, and most unshakable prejudice of them all
is the one in favour of you. Now, suppose you tell
me all about it.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t understand,” she murmured, and looked
up at him wide-eyed. “You’re so—so bewildering!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go further, then. If I say that even if you
killed Hoode and tell me so, I won’t move in any way
except to help you, will—you—tell—me—all—about—it?”</p>

<p>Those eyes blazed at him. “Do you dare to
suggest that I——”</p>

<p>“Oh, woman, Illogicality should be thy name,”
Anthony groaned. “I was merely endeavouring,
madam, to show how safe you’d be in telling me all
that you know. Listen. I’m in this business
privately. I oblige a friend. If I don’t like my own
conclusions, I shall say nothing about them. I seek
neither Fame nor Honorarium. I have, thank God,
more money than is good for me.” He was silent
for a moment, and then added: “Now, suppose you
tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>She half rose, then sank back into her chair. Her
eyes were full on his. For a moment that seemed
an hour he lost consciousness of all else. He saw
nothing, felt nothing, but those dark twin pools
and the little golden lights that danced deep down in
the darkness.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” she said at last. “I <em>will</em> tell
you”—she laughed a little—“all about it.”</p>

<p>Anthony bowed. “May I sit?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! Please, please forgive me!” She sprang
to her feet. “You look <em>so</em> tired—and I’ve kept you
standing all this time. And while I’ve been so
melodramatic, too. Is there anything you——”</p>

<p>“Only your story.” Anthony had discovered a need
to keep a hold upon himself. Contrition had made her,
impossibly, yet more beautiful. He pulled up a chair
and sat facing her.</p>

<p>The white hands twisted in her lap. She began:
“I—I hardly know where to begin. It’s all so—it
doesn’t seem real, only it’s too dreadful to be
anything else——”</p>

<p>“Why did you go to Abbotshall last night? And
why, in Heaven’s name, since you did go there, did
you choose to swim?” Anthony conceived that
questions would help.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t time to do anything else,” she said,
seeming to gather confidence. She went on, the words
tumbling over each other: “We’d been out all day—Dora
and I and some friends. I—when we got back——Dora
and I—there was only just time to change
for dinner. As I came in I saw some letters in the
hall, and remembered I’d not read them in the morning—we’d
been in such a hurry to start. Then I went and
forgot them again till after dinner.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t till after half-past ten that I thought
of them. And then, when—when I read the one from
Jimmy, I—I—oh, God!—” She covered her face
with her hands.</p>

<p>“Who,” said Anthony sharply, “is Jimmy?”</p>

<p>With an effort so great that it hurt him to watch,
she recovered. The hands dropped to her lap again.
He saw the long fingers twist about each other.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” she said, “is my brother. I’m most
awfully fond of him, you know. He <em>is</em> such a
darling! Only—only he’s not been quite the same since
he got back from Germany. He—he’s ill—and he’s—he’s
been d-drinking—and—he was a prisoner there
for three years! When they got him he was wounded
in the head and they never even—the beasts! The
beasts! Oh, Jim, darling——”</p>

<p>“That letter, madam,” Anthony was firm.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, the letter.” She choked back a sob.</p>

<p>“I—I read it. I read it, and I thought I should go
mad! He said he was going—going to sh-shoot
Hoode—that night!”</p>

<p>“Your brother? What had he to do with Hoode?”
Anthony was at once relieved and bewildered. He
knew why she had said, ‘Who shot him?’ But why
should Brother want to shoot?</p>

<p>She seemed not to have heard his question. “I
tried hard—ever so hard—to persuade myself that the
letter was all nonsense, that it was a practical joke,
or that Jimmy was ill or—or anything. But I couldn’t.
He—he was so precise. The train he was coming
by—and everything. The——”</p>

<p>“What had your brother to do with Hoode?”
Anthony interrupted. He felt that unless she were
kept severely to the point her self-control would
vanish altogether.</p>

<p>“He was his secretary until Archie took his
place—about six months ago. I—I never knew why Jimmy
left, he wouldn’t tell me. He wouldn’t tell me, I
say!”</p>

<p>Anthony shifted uneasily in his chair. There had
been a note of hysteria in those last words.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was on her feet. “He did it! He
did it!” she wailed, her hands flung above her head.
“Oh, Christ! he’ll be—oh, Jimmy, Jimmy!” And then
she began to laugh.</p>

<p>Anthony jumped at her, took her by the shoulders,
and shook. The ivory-white flesh seemed at once to
chill and burn his clutching fingers. With every
movement of his arms her head lolled helplessly.
Knowing himself right, he yet detested himself.</p>

<p>The dreadful laughter changed to sobbing; the
sobbing to silence.</p>

<p>“I’m s-sorry, p-please,” she said.</p>

<p>Anthony’s hands fell to his sides. “I,” he said, “am
a brute. Please sit down again.”</p>

<p>They sat. A silence fell.</p>

<p>At last he broke it. “Then you were so impressed
by the sincerity of your brother’s letter that you
determined you must try to stop him. Is that right?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“But why, in God’s name, didn’t you walk or run,
or do anything rather than swim?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t time. You see, it—it was so late—as
I explained—before I read the—the l-letter that
I knew th-that Jimmy was probably almost there.
There wasn’t time to—to—to——”</p>

<p>“I see. Judging that you’d save at least ten
minutes by crossing the river here, you pretended you
were going to bed, probably removed the more clinging
of your garments—if you didn’t put on a
bathing-dress—put on a pair of bathing-sandals to make
running easy without hindering swimming, slipped out
of the house quietly and beat all previous records to
Abbotshall by at least ten minutes. That right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Besides other emotions there was wonder
in her tones.</p>

<p>“Good. Now, when you were kneeling outside the
window of Hoode’s study, what did you see? You’ll
understand that if I am to be allowed to help you I
must find out all I can and as quickly as I can.”</p>

<p>Their lids veiled the great eyes. A convulsive
movement of the white throat told of the strain she
was under. When she spoke it was without feeling,
without emphasis, like a dull child repeating a lesson
memorised but not understood.</p>

<p>“I saw a man lying face-downwards by the fireplace.
There was blood on his head. It was a bald
head. I saw a clock half-fallen over; and chairs too.
And I came away. I ran to the river.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” Anthony asked slowly, “what
time it was when you got back here?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the lifeless ghost of the voice that had
thrilled him.</p>

<p>He was disappointed, and fell silent. Nothing new
here, except, of course, the brother. And of this
business of Brother James he did not yet know what
to think.</p>

<p>With this silence, Lucia’s cloak of impassivity left
her. ‘What shall we do?’ she whispered. “What
shall we do? They’ll find out that Jimmy—they’ll
find out. I <em>know</em> they will, I——”</p>

<p>“The police know nothing about your brother, Mrs.
Lemesurier.” Anthony’s tone was soothing. “And
if they did, they wouldn’t worry their heads about him.
You see, they’ve found a man they’re sure is the
murderer. There’s quite a good <i lang="la">prima facie</i> case
against him, too.”</p>

<p>Relief flooded her face with colour. For a moment
she lay relaxed in her chair; then suddenly sat bolt
upright again, her hands clutching at its arms.</p>

<p>“But—but if they’re accusing some one else, they—we
must tell them about—about—Jimmy.” Her face
was white, dead white, again.</p>

<p>“You go too fast, you know,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we’d better find out a few people
who didn’t do it before we unburden ourselves to the
Law?”</p>

<p>She laid eager hands on his arm. “You mean—you
think Jim didn’t—didn’t do it?”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. “More prejudice, you see. And
I know the man the bobbies have got hold of had
nothing to do with it either. Again prejudice. Bias,
lady, bias! There’s nothing like it to clear the head,
nothing! Now, have you a telephone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she said eagerly. Hope, trust and other
emotions showed in the velvet darkness of her eyes.</p>

<p>“And your brother’s address?”</p>

<p>Unhesitatingly she gave it; then added: “The
phone’s in here.” She pointed to a writing-table at
the far end of the room.</p>

<p>As he turned to go to it, she clutched again at his
arm. “Damn it!” thought Anthony. “I <em>wish</em> she
wouldn’t keep doing that. So disturbing!” But he
smiled down at her.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it dangerous to use the telephone?” she
whispered. “Isn’t it? The girls at the exchange—if
you use his name——”</p>

<p>“Credit me with guile,” smiled Anthony.</p>

<p>He crossed the room, sat by the table and pulled
the instrument towards him. She stood beside him,
her fingers gripping the back of his chair. He lifted
the receiver and asked for a city number.</p>

<p>“Is it a trunk-call?” he added. “No? Good!”</p>

<p>To Lucia, her heart in her mouth, it seemed hours
before he spoke again. Then—</p>

<p>“Hallo. That <i>The Owl</i> office?” he said. “It is?
Well, put me on to Mr. Hastings, please. At once.
You can’t? My child, if I’m not put through <em>at once</em>
you’ll go to-morrow! Understand?” A pause. To
Lucia it seemed that the heavy thudding of her heart
must be filling the room with sound. She pressed a
hand to her breast.</p>

<p>Then Anthony’s voice again. “Ah, that you, Spencer?
Oh, it’s the unerring Miss Warren, is it? Yes,
Gethryn speaking. He is, is he? When’ll he be back?
Or won’t he? Oh, you’re all always there until
after midnight, are you? Well, when he comes in, will
you please tell him—this is important—that I’ve run
across some one who knows where our old friend
Masterson, Jimmy Masterson, is. Hastings will want
to see him at once, I know. He and I have been trying
to find Masterson for years. And say that I want to
find out what Jimmy was doing last night. Tell
Hastings to ask him or find out somehow where he was.
It’s a great joke.</p>

<p>“The address is 84, Forest Road, N.W. 5. Now,
Miss Warren, if you wouldn’t mind repeating the
message?” A pause. Then: “That’s exactly right,
Miss Warren, thanks. You never make mistakes, do
you? Don’t forget to tell Hastings he simply must
go there this evening, whether the work’ll allow him
or not. And he’s got to ring me up here—Greyne 23—and
tell me how he got on. And, by the way, ask him
from me if he remembers his Cicero, and tell him I
said: <i lang="la">Haec res maxim est: statim pare.</i> Got it? I
won’t insult you by offering to spell it.</p>

<p>“Thanks so much, Miss Warren. Good-night.”</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver and rose from his chair.
He turned to find the face of his hostess within an
inch of his own. The colour had fled again from her
cheeks; the eyes again held fear in them. It seemed
as if this passing-on of her brother’s name had revived
her terror.</p>

<p>“Preserve absolute calm,” said Anthony softly.
“The cry of the moment is ‘dinna fash.’ ”. Gently, he
forced her into a chair.</p>

<p>The eyes were piteous now. “I don’t—I don’t
understand <em>anything!</em>” she gasped. “What was that
message? What will it do? What am I to—to do?
Oh, don’t go! Please don’t go!”</p>

<p>“The message,” Anthony said, “was to a great
friend whose discretion is second only to mine own.
Don’t you think it was a nice message? Nothing there
any long ears at the exchange could make use of, was
there? All so nice and above board, I thought. And
I liked the very canine Latin labelled libellously ‘Cicero.’
That was to make sure he understood that the affair
was urgent. The need for discretion he’ll gather from
the way the message was wrapped up. Oh, I’m
undoubtedly a one, I am!</p>

<p>“And as for going, I’m not until I’ve had an
answer from Hastings. That ought to be about
midnight. At least, I won’t go unless you ask me to.”
He sat down, heavily, upon a sofa.</p>

<p>Something—his calmness, perhaps—succeeded. He
saw the fear leave the face, that face of his dreams.
For a moment, he closed his eyes. He was thirsty
for sleep, yet desired wakefulness. She glanced at
him, timidly almost, and saw the deep lines of fatigue
in the thin face, the shadows under the eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gethryn,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Anthony’s eyes opened.</p>

<p>“You look <em>so</em> tired! I feel responsible. I’ve been
so very difficult, haven’t I? But I’m not going to
be silly any more. And—and isn’t there anything I
can do? You <em>are</em> tired, you know.”</p>

<p>Anthony smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>Suddenly: “Fool that I am!” she exclaimed; and
was gone from the room.</p>

<p>Anthony blinked wonderingly. He found consecutive
thought difficult. This sudden recurrence of
fatigue was a nuisance. “Haven’t seen her laugh yet,”
he murmured. “Must make her laugh. Want to
hear. Now, what in hell do we do if Brother James
turns out to be the dastardly assassin after all? But
I don’t believe he is. It wouldn’t fit. No, not at
all!”</p>

<p>His eyes closed. With an effort, he opened them.
To hold sleep at bay he picked up a book that lay beside
him on the couch. He found it to be a collection
of essays, seemingly written in pleasant and even
scholarly fashion. He flicked over the leaves. A
passage caught his eye. “And so it is with the
romantic. He is as a woman enslaved by drugs. From
that first little sniff grows the craving, from the craving
the necessity, from the necessity—<i lang="la">facilis descensus
Averno</i>.…”</p>

<p>The quotation set his mind working lazily. So
unusual to find that dative case; they nearly all used
the almost-as-correct but less pleasant ‘<i lang="la">Averni</i>.’ But
he seemed to have seen ‘<i lang="la">Averno</i>’ somewhere else, quite
recently, too. Funny coincidence.</p>

<p>The book slipped from his hand to the floor. In a
soft wave, sleep came over him again. His eyes
closed.</p>

<p>He opened them to hear the door of the room closed
softly. From behind him came a pleasant sound. He
sat upright, turning to investigate.</p>

<p>Beside a small, tray-laden table stood his hostess.
She was pouring whisky from decanter to tumbler with
a grave preoccupation which lent an added charm to
her beauty. Anthony, barely awake, exclaimed aloud.</p>

<p>She turned in a flash. “You were asleep,” she said,
and blushed under the stare of the green eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m so psychic, you know,” sighed Anthony. “I
always know when spirits are about.”</p>

<p>She laughed; and the sound gave him more pleasure
even that he had anticipated. Like her voice, it was
low and soft and golden.</p>

<p>She lifted the decanter again. “Say when,” she
said, and when he had said it: “Soda?”</p>

<p>“Please—a little.” He took the glass from her hand
and tasted. “Mrs. Lemesurier, I have spent my day in
ever-increasing admiration of you. But now you
surpass yourself. This whisky—prewar, I think?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She nodded absently, then burst out:
“Tell me, why are you doing all this for me—taking
all this trouble? Tell me!”</p>

<p>To-night Anthony’s mind was running in a Latin
groove. “<i lang="la">Veni, vidi, vicisti!</i>” he said, and drained
his glass.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch08">

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br/> The Inefficiency of Margaret</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Miss Margaret Warren, severely exquisite
as to dress, golden hair as sleek as if
she were about to begin rather than finish the day’s
work, sat at her table in Hastings’s room.</p>

<p>Before her was the pad on which, ten minutes ago,
she had written Anthony’s message. She knew it by
heart. As the minutes passed she grew more troubled
at her employer’s absence. Here—it was obvious—was
something which ought to be done without waste
of time; and time had already been wasted. She
knew Colonel Gethryn well enough to be sure that the
talk about a “great joke” had been camouflage. No,
this was all something to do with the murder. Had
he not said with emphasis that Ja—Mr. Hastings was
to ring him up as soon as he had found this man
Masterson? He had, and all had to know, it seemed,
where this man Masterson had been on Thursday
night, the night Hoode had been killed.…</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” thought Margaret, “that either
of them know this man Masterson at all. That’s all
part of the camouflage, that is. And then there’s that
bit of terrible Latin. I thought better of Colonel
Gethryn, I did. Still, there it is: ‘This matter is
of the greatest importance. Obey immediately.’
Cicero indeed!”</p>

<p>She glanced at her watch. A quarter of an hour
wasted already!</p>

<p>An idea came to her. Hastings had gone out for
food. In that case he might, if he had indeed gone
there, still be at that pseudo-Johnsonian haunt, The
Cock. Thither she sent a messenger, hot-foot. He
was back within five minutes, No, the boss wasn’t
there.</p>

<p>“Damn!” said Miss Warren.</p>

<p>She looked again at her watch. Twenty past ten.
She put on her hat—the little black hat which played
such havoc with the emotions of the editor. The copy
of Anthony’s message she placed on Hastings’s table,
together with another hastily scribbled note. Then she
went down the stairs and out into Fleet Street.</p>

<p>After three attempts, she found a taxi whose driver
was willing to take her so far afield as Forest
Road, N.W. 5.</p>

<p>The journey, the driver said, would take ’arfenar
or thereabouts. Margaret employed it in constructing
two stories, one to be used if this man Masterson
turned out to be over fifty, the other if he were
under. They were good tales, and she was pleased
with them. The “under-fifty” one involved an Old
Mother, Mistaken Identity, and an Ailing Fiancee.
The “over-fifty” one was, if anything, better,
dealing as it did with A Maiden from Canada, A <i>Times</i>
“Agony,” Tears, A Lost Kitten, and A Railway
Journey. Both tales were ingeniously devised to
provide ample opportunity for innocently questioning
this man Masterson as to his whereabouts on the night
of Thursday.</p>

<p>The taxi pulled up. The driver opened the door.
“ ’Ere y’are, miss. Number fourteen.”</p>

<p>As she paid the fare, Miss Warren discovered her
heart to be misbehaving. This annoyed her. She
strove to master this perturbation, but met with little
enough success.</p>

<p>The taxi jolted away down the hill. The road was
quiet; too quiet, Margaret thought. Also it was
dismal, too dismal. There were too few lamps. There
was not even a moon. There didn’t seem to be any
lighted windows. A nasty, inhospitable road.</p>

<p>She perceived No. 14 to be a “converted” house.
A great black building that might once have housed
a merchant prince, but was now the warren of retired
grocers, oddities, solicitors, and divorcees.</p>

<p>Margaret mounted the steps, slowly. The porter’s
lobby in the hall was empty. From one of a series
of brass plates she divined that flat <b>6b</b> was the burrow
of one James Masterson. Flat <b>6b</b>, it seemed, was on
the first floor. The lift was unattended. She walked
up the stairs.</p>

<p>Frantically she reviewed her stories, testing them
at every point. She wished she hadn’t come, had
waited till Hastings had got back!</p>

<p>Facing the door of Flat <b>6b</b>, Miss Margaret Warren
took herself in hand, addressed rude remarks to
herself, and applied firm pressure to the bell-push.</p>

<p>There was no sound of footsteps; there was no
hand on the latch—but the door swung open.</p>

<p>Margaret fell back, stifling a scream. A small
squeak broke from her lips. It was such a funny
squeak that it made her laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Margaret,” she told herself sternly.
“Haven’t you heard of contraptions to open doors?
Hundred per cent. labour-saving.”</p>

<p>But her heart was thudding violently as she entered
the little hall. From a room on her right came a man’s
voice, querulous, high-pitched.</p>

<p>“Who’s that,” it said. “Come in, damn you!
Come in!”</p>

<p>She turned the handle, and entered a bedroom well
furnished but in a state of appalling disorder. A dying
fire—the temperature that day had been over ninety
in the shade—belched out from the littered grate
occasional puffs of black smoke. The bed-clothes were
tossed and rumpled; half of them on the floor. A
small table sprawled on its side in the middle of the
room. Crumpled newspapers were everywhere, everywhere.
Huddled in an arm-chair by the fireplace was
a man.</p>

<p>His hair was wild, his eyes bright, burning with
fever, A stubble of black beard was over the thin
face. Over his cheek-bones was spread a brilliant
flush. A man obviously ill, with temperature running
high.</p>

<p>One must sympathise with Margaret. She had
expected any scene but this. Again fear seized her.
What a fool she had been to come! What a fool!
This man Masterson was ill; yet she couldn’t feel sorry
for him. Those over-bright eyes fixed on hers were
so malevolent somehow.</p>

<p>She stammered something. Her mouth was so dry
that coherent speech seemed impossible.</p>

<p>Then the man got out of his chair. Dully, she
noticed how great was the tax on his strength. He
clutched at the mantel for support. Dislodged by his
elbow, a bottle crashed down and splintered on the
tiles of the hearth. The smell of whisky, which always
made her feel sick, combined with apprehension and
the heat of the room, to set Margaret’s senses dancing
a fantastic reel.</p>

<p>Clutching the mantelpiece, the man attempted a bow.
“You must pardon my appearance,” he said, and his
voice made the girl shrink back, “but I am—am at your
service. Oh, yes, believe me. What can I have the
great pleasure of—of doing for you? Eh?”</p>

<p>He started to move towards her, aiding his trembling
legs by scrabbling at the wall. Margaret felt a desire
to scream; choked the scream back. She tried to burst
into speech, to say something, anything, to tell one
of her stories that she had been so proud of. She
failed utterly.</p>

<p>The man continued his spider-like approach.</p>

<p>“Go back! Go back!” Margaret whispered. She
was shaking, shaking all over.</p>

<p>But the man had left the wall, and without its
support had fallen to his knees. His head lolling
with every movement, he crawled to the over-turned
table and searched among the litter of newspaper
beside it.</p>

<p>Margaret cast longing eyes at the door. She tried
to move, but her legs would not obey her. Fascinated
by the horror of the thing, she looked down at the
man. Her eye caught heavy headlines on the tumbled
papers.</p>

<p>“Abbotshall Murder! Cabinet Minister Assassinated!
Horrible Atrocity! Is it Bolshevism?” they
shrieked in letters two inches high.</p>

<p>And the man—this man Masterson—had found what
he wanted. He sat grotesquely on the carpet, holding
in both hands the butt of a heavy automatic pistol.
The barrel pointed straight at Margaret’s head. A
queer, sick feeling came over her. She felt her knees
grow weak beneath her.</p>

<p>“Sit down. Sit down, will you!” The man’s tones
were harsh, cracked—the voice of one ill to the point
of collapse.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Spencer Hastings stood disconsolate on the threshold
of the editorial chamber. He had supped with a
friend who was an artist. The artist had talked.
Spencer Hastings had been later than he had intended
in returning to the office. When he did—she had
gone.</p>

<p>“Damn it! Oh, damn it!” he said fervently.</p>

<p>One must sympathise with him. He was ashamed,
bitterly ashamed, of himself. For the ten thousandth
time he thought it all over. Hell! He was badly in
love with the woman, why didn’t he grab hold of her
and tell her so? Why was it that he couldn’t? Because
he was afraid. Afraid of her aloof beauty, her
completeness, her thrice-to-be-damned efficiency—how he
loathed that word beloved of Babbitts! If only she
weren’t quite so—so infernally and perpetually equal to
the situation!</p>

<p>Yes, he was afraid, that’s what it was! He, Spencer
Sutherland Hastings, sometimes the fastest
three-quarter in England, sometime something of an ace in
the Flying Corps, renowned in old days for his easy
conquest of Woman, he was afraid! Afraid forsooth
of a little slip of a thing he could almost hang on his
watch-chain! Disgusting, he found himself!</p>

<p>He flitted dejectedly about the room. Should he go
home? No, he’d better do some work; there’d be an
easy time coming soon.</p>

<p>He crossed the room and sat down at his table. Two
slips of paper, both covered with Margaret’s clear,
decisive handwriting, stared up at him.</p>

<p>He read and re-read. Here was more Efficiency!
Undoubtedly she had put its real meaning to Anthony’s
message. In his mind alarm replaced that mixture of
irritation and reverence. “I thought this should be
attended to at once, so have gone to the address given by
Colonel Gethryn,” she had written. Aloud, Hastings
heaped curses upon the loquacity of the artist with
whom he had supped.</p>

<p>He read the message and the note a third time, then
jumped to his feet. That little white darling to go,
alone and at such a time, to the house of a man who
might be—well, a murderer! Of course, Anthony
might only be after a possible witness, but——</p>

<p>He seized his hat and made for the stairs and Fleet
Street.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Margaret lay huddled in the uncomfortable chair.
For perhaps the hundredth time she choked back the
scream which persisted in rising to her lips. Every
suppression was more difficult than its predecessor.</p>

<p>Still, though she seemed to have been looking down
it for an eternity, the black ring which was the muzzle
of the automatic stared straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>The man had not moved. He was crouched upon
the floor, no part of him steady save the hands which
held the pistol. And he went on talking. Margaret
felt that the rest of her life was a dream; that
always, in reality, he had been talking and she
listening.</p>

<p>And the talk—always the same story. “You’re
clever, aren’t you? Very clever, eh? ‘Who killed
Hoode?’ you said to yourselves—you and your friends.
I don’t know you, but you’re Scotland Yard, that’s
what you are. Well, if you want to know <em>I did!</em>
See? But, my golden child, I’m not going to tell
any one! Oh, no! Oh, no!”</p>

<p>There was much more of words but none of sense.
He went on talking, and always the burden of his
whispering, his half-shouting, his mumbling, was the
same. “I killed Hoode! But I’m not going to tell
any one, oh, no! Thought he could play about with
me, did he? Get rid of the man who was helping
him, eh? Fool!”</p>

<p>Once she had tried to rise, intending a wild dash
for the front door she knew had not shut behind
her. But the pistol had been thrust forward with
such menace that ever since she had been as still as
stone. Her right leg, twisted beneath her, was agony.
Her head seemed bursting.</p>

<p>At last there came a pause in the babbling talk.
The man began to struggle to his feet. Margaret
shrank back still farther into her chair. Even as he
heaved himself upright the gun never wavered from
her.</p>

<p>Another scream rose in her throat, only to be fought
back. He was up now, and coming towards her with
wavering steps. Even in her terror she could see
that his fever had increased. She prayed for his
collapse as she had never prayed before.</p>

<p>He was close, close! Margaret shut her eyes,
screwing up the lids.</p>

<p>She heard a rush of feet outside the door. Some
one burst into the room. Slowly, unbelieving, she
opened the blue eyes. Hastings stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p>A black mist flickered before her. Through it, as
if she were looking through smoked glass, she saw
him walk swiftly, his right hand outstretched as if
in greeting, up to the unsteady, malevolent figure in
the dressing-gown.</p>

<p>The mist before her eyes grew thicker, darker.
When it had cleared again, Hastings had the pistol
in his hand. As she watched, the numbness of fear
still upon her, the man Masterson crumpled to the
floor.</p>

<p>With a great effort she rose from the chair. On
her feet, she stumbled. She felt herself falling, gave
a piteous little cry, and was caught up in Hastings’s
arms.</p>

<p>Now that safety had come she broke down. Her
body shook with sobs. Then came tears and more
tears. She burrowed her face into Hastings’s shoulder,
rubbing her cheek up and down against the smooth
cloth of his coat.</p>

<p>Hastings, his heart beating too fast for comfort,
looked down. All he could see was the little black
hat. The shaking of her body in his arms, the very
fact that in his arms she was, deprived him of speech.
They remained locked together. From the floor
behind them came a hoarse, delirious babbling. Neither
man nor woman heard it.</p>

<p>The sobbing grew quieter. A great resolve swelled
in Hastings’s bosom.</p>

<p>“I w-want a—a hanky,” said a small voice from
his shoulder.</p>

<p>From his breast pocket he whipped a square foot
of white silk. A little hand snatched at it. Its work
completed, she smiled up at him, then endeavoured to
withdraw from his arms. Hastings held on.</p>

<p>“Please,” said the small voice, “will you let me
go?”</p>

<p>“No!” roared Hastings. “No! Never any more!”</p>

<p>Slowly, she raised her head to look at him again.
Immediately, thoroughly, satisfyingly, he kissed her.
For a moment, a fleeting fraction of time, it seemed
to him that the soft lips had answered the pressure
of his.</p>

<p>But then she broke free. “<em>Mr. Hastings!</em>” She
stamped her foot. “How dare——”</p>

<p>A grin of delight was on his face. “ ’Sno use,”
he murmured. “ ’Sno use any more. I’m not
frightened of you now, you <em>darling!</em>” He snatched at
her again.</p>

<p>From the floor there came again that hoarse mutter.
Again they didn’t hear it.</p>

<p>“And you know you’ve been in love with me for
years,” said Hastings.</p>

<p>“Oh! I have <em>not</em>!” She was all indignation.
Suddenly it went. “Yes, I have, though—for months,
anyway. Oh, Jack, Jack, why didn’t you do this
before?”</p>

<p>“Frightened,” said Hastings. “Wind up.”</p>

<p>“But—but whatever of?”</p>

<p>“You—and your damned sufficient efficiency.
Yesterday I swore to myself I’d pluck up the nerve to
tell you as soon as I caught you, red-handed, making
a mistake. And you see I have——”</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed. “What d’you mean? <em>Mistake!</em>
I like that! When I’ve caught the murderer——”</p>

<p>They both swung round, remembrance flooding back.
The owner of the flat lay beside the over-turned
table, a shapeless heap in the dark dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Margaret shivered. “Mistake, indeed!” she began.</p>

<p>“Well, you did. This is a man’s job. You ought
to’ve waited till I came back. God! how you
frightened me! Suppose this outer door here hadn’t been
ajar.”</p>

<p>“But, Jack——”</p>

<p>Hastings forgot murders. “Why d’you call me
that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“ ’Cause I couldn’t always be saying ‘Spencer.’
I’d feel like a heroine in a serial. And don’t
interrupt. I was going to say: Never mind, we’ve got
the man. Won’t Colonel Gethryn be pleased?”</p>

<p>Hastings came back to earth. “By God!” he said.
“So that’s the murderer, is it? So it was that
Gethryn was after. Well, he’s a very ill criminal.
How d’you know he is one, by the way?”</p>

<p>“He confessed. He was sort of delirious. Kept
saying he’d done it, but wasn’t going to tell any one.
Horrid it was!”</p>

<p>Hastings rubbed his chin. “I wonder,” he said.
“I wonder. Come on, we’re going to have a nice
diplomatic talk with that porter I saw downstairs.
And don’t forget we mustn’t let him get a line on
what we’re after.”</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The hands of the clock in Mrs. Lemesurier’s
drawing-room stood at five minutes to midnight.</p>

<p>There came a lull in the conversation which Anthony
had kept flowing since he had sent his message to
Hastings. A wandering talk it had been, but he had
achieved his object. Save for the harassed look about
her eyes, there was now nothing to tell of the strain the
woman had been under. She had even laughed, not
once but many times. She was, in fact, almost normal.
And Anthony rejoiced, for he had found her to
possess humour, wit and wisdom to support her beauty.
She was, he thought sleepily to himself, almost too
good to be true.</p>

<p>For a moment his eyes closed. Behind the lids
there rose a picture of her face—a picture strangely
more clear than any given by actual sight.</p>

<p>“You,” said Lucia, “ought to be asleep. Yes, you
ought! Not tiring yourself out to make conversation
for an hysterical woman that can’t keep her emotions
under control.”</p>

<p>“The closing of the eyes,” Anthony said, opening
them, “merely indicates that the great detective is what
we call thrashing out a knotty problem. He always
closes his eyes, you know. He couldn’t do anything
with ’em open.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “I’m afraid I don’t believe you, you
know. I think you’ve done so much to-day that you’re
simply tired out.”</p>

<p>“Really, I assure you, no. We never sleep until a
case is finished. Never. It’s rather sad in this one,
because I can see it going on for ever.” He saw her
mouth contract with the pain of fear, and went on:
“I mean, I don’t believe we’re ever going to catch the
Sparrow.”</p>

<p>“The Sparrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you remember ‘Who killed Cock
Robin’? It must have been the first detective story
you ever read. You know, it was the Sparrow who
did the dirty work. ‘And here, in a manner of
speaking, we all are.’ All at sixes and sevens, that is.
Here am I, come to the decision that either A. R.
Gethryn or the rest of the world is mad. There are
the police with entirely the wrong bird.</p>

<p>“The only real bit of work I’ve done to-day,” he
went on, “has led me to find, not an answer, but
another problem. The question is: was a certain thing
done genuinely or was it done to look as if it had
been done genuinely, or was it done in the way it
was on purpose to look ungenuine? The answer, at
present, is a lemon.”</p>

<p>Again she smiled. “It sounds awful,” she said.
Then, with a change of tone: “But—but my brother?
You were saying——”</p>

<p>Piercing, blaring, came the angry ring of the
telephone.</p>

<p>Lucia leapt to her feet with a cry. Before she
could move again Anthony was at the instrument. As
he lifted the receiver she reached his side, pleading
with eyes and hands for permission to use the extra
ear-piece.</p>

<p>“Carry on,” he said; and into the transmitter:
“Hallo!”</p>

<p>She snatched at the black disc, to hear: “That you,
Gethryn?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Hastings?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve done that job——”</p>

<p>“What did you find?” Anthony snapped, laying a
reassuring hand on the white shoulder beside him.
He felt that her whole body was shaking.</p>

<p>The telephone made meaningless cackles.</p>

<p>“What——”</p>

<p>“I said,” came a squeak of a voice, “that the man
your message referred to—er—said that it was he
who had pulled off that deal you were asking about.”</p>

<p>Anthony flashed a glance at the woman beside him.
With surprise and admiration he saw that there were
no signs of collapse. The hand which held the
extra receiver was steady as his own, the head was
held erect. Only the pallor of the face, extending even
to the lips, told of the shock.</p>

<p>The telephone had again relapsed into mere cackling
and buzzing.</p>

<p>Anthony gave vent to his feelings. “Blast you!
Speak more clearly. Go on from where he said that
it was his deal.”</p>

<p>“And blast ye, too, scum!” came in a hilarious
wheeze. “I said that the extraordinary part of the
business was that I found out that the merchant must
have—cackle—cackle—bahk-bahk——”</p>

<p>“Hell! Repeat! <em>What</em> did you find out?”</p>

<p>“I said that the chap must have dreamed it all.
I found out that he couldn’t possibly have had anything
to do with the thing. Why on earth he thought
<em>he’d</em>—er—put this deal through, I can’t say—unless the
explanation is that he got the idea that he would do
it when he began to be so ill, put in a goodish bit of
brooding, and then, when it <em>was</em> done and he heard
about it, got all mixed and thought he was really
the—er—manipulator of the business. Anyway, it’s
certain he couldn’t’ve had anything to do with it at all.
Take it from me.”</p>

<p>Lucia staggered, then sank weakly into a chair,
still clasping the black disc to her ear. Anthony
glanced at her; saw that the colour had come flooding
back to her face.</p>

<p>“You’re sure about this?” he asked the telephone.</p>

<p>“See it wet, see it dry. The man lives by
himself. He’s been ill for five days. I got that from
the porter of the flats. This porter told me that
J.M. hasn’t been outside his front door for a week.
The story’s right enough. You’ve only got to look
at the chap to see he’s too ill to have been trotting
about. There’s not a doubt. You disappointed?”</p>

<p>“God, no! Hastings, my brother, I kiss your hands.
And I congratulate you. From what I know, your
explanation of why J.M. thought what he did is
right. But tell me, how ill is he?”</p>

<p>“Baddish, but by no means dying. Er—as a
matter of fact, the doctor’s with him now. Severe
flu, I think it is, plus old-standing shell-shock or
something like that probably.”</p>

<p>Lucia stirred uneasily in her chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, the doctor’s with him, is he? Now, what
doctor?” Anthony said.</p>

<p>“Well—er—as a matter of fact—er”—bubbled the
telephone in embarrassed accents—“I—we—have taken
him back to my place. D’you know the man?”</p>

<p>“I’m, well, interested in him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s all right now, you know. You see,
we—I felt rather sorry—fellow’s seedy and no one
to look after him. We felt rather that we owed him
something for false suspicion, what? Hope you don’t
mind my taking charge.”</p>

<p>“Mind? I’m very grateful! You’re an excellent
man. But why the hesitancy, the embarrassment?
Why all this we—I—us—we? I become aware of
a rat.”</p>

<p>“Because I’ve done it!” roared the telephone
ecstatically. “I’ve asked her. I’m going to be married.
She——”</p>

<p>“One moment. Miss Warren, I gather?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried the telephone. “Congratulate me!”</p>

<p>“I pound your spirit on the back. Tell Miss
Warren this is the only mistake I’ve ever known her to
make. I’ll offer my felicitations in person to-morrow.
Now, listen.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“I want you,” said Anthony, “to come down here—you’ll
find it best to do it by car—to-morrow and
attend the inquest. It’s being held at the
house—Abbotshall—and it begins at eleven o’clock in the
morning. If you bring Miss Warren with you,
please ask her whether she will take a complete
shorthand note of the proceedings. If she can’t come,
get an ordinary shorthand person. I’d rather she did
it, of course. After the inquest go to the Bear and
Key in Marling and ask for me. I shall want to
pump you. Got that?”</p>

<p>“Very good, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“If you see me at the house during the inquest
don’t speak to me or do anything to attract attention
to me. Got it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Right. Good-bye, and again congratulations.”
Anthony hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>He turned to Lucia. She lay limply in the chair.
After the first wild surge of relief had come reaction.</p>

<p>The spare receiver had fallen from her hand. Her
breast heaved as if she fought for breath.</p>

<p>Anthony poured whisky into a tumbler; added a
little soda-water. He forced the glass into her hand.</p>

<p>“Drink that,” he said.</p>

<p>Obediently, like a child, she drank, looking up at
him over the rim of the glass.</p>

<p>When she had finished, “Feeling better?” he asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed gratitude. “Ever so much. Oh!
you don’t know how—what a horrible, <em>awful</em> day I’ve
had!”</p>

<p>“I can guess,” Anthony said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know; I know you can! I didn’t mean that
you—— How can I ever thank you enough?”</p>

<p>“Thank me? Why, you know, it seems I’ve done
nothing much yet except make a fool of myself running
down blind alleys.”</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet. “Done nothing! Done
nothing!” she blazed at him. “How dare you say such
a thing! Why, if it hadn’t been for you and—and
your cleverness I would never have known Jimmy was
safe. I’d just have gone on and on thinking horrors
to myself.” Suddenly all the fire died out of her.
“And I think I should have died,” she added quietly.</p>

<p>Anthony said: “You overwhelm me. You can
reward me best by allowing me to hope our acquaintance
isn’t ended.”</p>

<p>Her eyes opened in amazement. “Why, <em>of course!</em>”
she said. “But we’re friends already, aren’t we? At
least, I am.”</p>

<p>Anthony was silent. The only answer he wanted
to make were best unsaid. He rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I must go,” he said. “May I suggest that I get
my friend Hastings to drive you up to town to-morrow
to see your brother. That’ll be some time in the
afternoon, after the inquest.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gethryn, you thinking of everything,
everything! May I? I love Mr. Hastings already—for
taking such care of Jimmy, poor darling, when he
didn’t know him from Adam.” She smiled; and
Anthony caught his breath.</p>

<p>He made a move in the direction of the door; then
paused. “Mrs. Lemesurier,” he said, “you can’t, I
suppose, tell me anything I haven’t already picked up
about the Abbotshall <i lang="fr">ménage</i>?” Business seemed safer
ground when his emotions were so hard to repress.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I’m sorry; I can’t. Except
Sir Arthur—and he’s only a guest—I hardly know
anything about them. Mr. Hoode I met twice. I’ve never
seen his sister. I dare say I should have known them
quite well by this time if Jim hadn’t left Mr. Hoode in
that funny way. But after that—well, it was rather
awkward somehow, and we just haven’t mixed.”</p>

<p>“D’you know this Mrs. Mainwaring at all?”</p>

<p>“Not at all except from the illustrated papers.”</p>

<p>“Oh. So she’s what Zenith might call a Society
Snake, is she? Well, well. Not a tennis champion or
a plus-four person as well, is she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I’m sure she isn’t. Mr. Gethryn, why
all this curiosity?”</p>

<p>Anthony smiled. “Now don’t get scenting murderers
in everything I say, will you. Merely my
’satiable curtiosity. I shall be punished for it one day.
‘And his tall aunt the ostrich spanked him with her
hard, hard claw.’ That was for ’satiable curtiosity,
you remember.” He turned to the door. “I really
must go now.”</p>

<p>She stopped him, laying a hand on his arm. “Mr.
Gethryn, one minute. Now that—owing to you—I’m
happy again, I’m like the elephant’s child, too, simply
bursting with curtiosity. Who <em>did</em> do it?”</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. “I haven’t the faintest idea—yet.
On the subject of who didn’t do it I could talk for
hours. ‘But whose the dastard hand that held the
knife I know not; nor the reason for the strife.’ ”</p>

<p>“But you’re going to find out, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I have hope, lady.”</p>

<p>The black eyes held the green ones for a long
moment. “I think,” she said at last, “that you’re the most
extraordinary man I’ve ever met. Some day, you must
tell me how you knew everything I did last night. I
believe you were watching me; only you couldn’t have
been.”</p>

<p>“I,” said Anthony, opening the door, “I am Dupont,
I am Lecoq, I’m Fortune, Holmes and Rouletabille.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>She was left staring at the closed door. When she

<h2>Chapter IX. <br/> The Inquest</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>At ten o’clock the next morning they brought a
note to Lucia, radiant from a nine hours’ sleep.</p>

<blockquote class="letter"><div>

<p>“<span class="salutation">My Dear Mrs. Lemesurier</span>”— she read—“Hastings’s
car, its owner and I will call for you at some time
between four and five this afternoon.</p>

<p>“Do not attend the inquest this morning, and
above all prevent your sister from doing so. No
doubt this warning is unnecessary, but I thought
safer to issue it. For it is highly probable that the
coroner’s jury will return a verdict of murder against
Archibald Deacon.</p>

<p>“Do not worry about this. Deacon had nothing
to do with this messy business. (The great god Bias
again, you see.) At the moment, however, things
look bad for him. But I repeat: do not worry.
Also, prevent your sister (I understand there is an
alliance) from doing so more than is unavoidable. I
promise things shall be straightened out.</p>

<p class="valediction">“Yours optimistically,</p>
<p class="signature">“Anthony Gethryn.”</p>

<p>“P.S.—I find that yesterday I omitted to return
to you a bathing-sandal which I found. I ought to
have sent it with this letter; but have decided to
keep it.”</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>Lucia, after the first shock, obeyed orders. Fond
as she was of her sister and her sister’s titanic lover,
she found worry, for this morning at least, impossible.
After the events of yesterday, she somehow discovered
herself possessed of a childlike faith in the power
of Anthony Gethryn to work necessary miracles.</p>

<p>She told Dora; then spent the morning to such
purpose that the girl’s fears were in some measure
allayed.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>At ten minutes to eleven Anthony left the Bear
and Key and walked slowly in the direction of
Abbotshall. He was tired and very tired. In spite
of his fatigue he had barely slept. There had been
so much to think about. And also so much which,
though nothing to do with this work of his, had yet
insisted on being thought about.</p>

<p>He entered the house at five minutes past the hour.
Proceedings were being opened. The coroner and
his jury had just seated themselves round the long
table set for them in the study.</p>

<p>All about was an air of drama, heightened by the
intensity of public feeling and the fact that the court
was set on the actual scene of the crime. Marling
felt the eyes and ears of the world bent in its direction.
It rather enjoyed the feeling, but nevertheless went
sternly, and with due solemnity, about its duty.</p>

<p>Anthony nodded to Boyd, shook hands with Deacon,
ignored Hastings and Margaret Warren, already
seated at the press table, and ran an eye over the
jury.</p>

<p>The sight depressed him. “Mutton!” he murmured.</p>

<p>The coroner rapped the table, cleared his throat, and
opened the court.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Superintendent Boyd turned to
address a remark to Colonel Gethryn. But Colonel
Gethryn was no longer there. Nor, apparently, was
he anywhere else in the room. Boyd shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Anthony was in the hall. In the far corner, by
the front door, stood a knot of servants. They were
clearly absorbed in their talk. On the steps were two
policemen, their blue backs towards him. Slowly,
Anthony mounted the wide, curving staircase. Once
out of sight from below, his pace quickened to a run.</p>

<p>On the first floor he found his hopes realised. It
was depopulated. As he had calculated, the whole
household was downstairs.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The court adjourned at fifteen minutes to two.
Hastings and a different, softer, more charming than
ever Margaret Warren were given lunch by Anthony
in his sitting-room at the Bear and Key.</p>

<p>The meal over, Margaret was given the one
comfortable chair, Hastings sat on the table, and Anthony
leaned against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“Now, my children,” he said, “I have congratulated
you, I have filled your stomachs. To work. What
of the crowner’s quest?”</p>

<p>“Adjourned till three-thirty,” said Hastings, “when,
after a quarter of an hour’s cosy talk, they’ll bring
in a red-hot verdict of willful murder aganst the
hulking private secretary. We needn’t go back, I think.
There’s one of our men there. He’ll take the rest of
the report; and it’s all over except the shouting.”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. “No, you needn’t stay.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em>,” said Margaret, “don’t think the secretary had
anything to do with it. Not with those sort of
eyes—he couldn’t.”</p>

<p>Hastings guffawed.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Miss Warren,” Anthony said.
“And it was the eyes which made me think that
way.”</p>

<p>Hastings exploded. “Oh! I say! But——”</p>

<p>“Quiet, dog!” Anthony waved him to silence. “I
am Richard on the Spot. The case is mine, and I
say that Archibald Deacon’s a non-starter. Children,
I am about to question you. Make ready.”</p>

<p>Hastings cast his smile. Margaret produced a
notebook.</p>

<p>Anthony said: “So far, the case against Deacon
is, I assume: one, that in his possession were found
bank-notes for a hundred pounds proved as having
been drawn by Hoode from his bank on the morning
of the murder; two, that his explanation that this
money was given to him by Hoode as a birthday
present was neither regarded as at all probable nor
supported by any witness; three, that his explanation
as to his whereabouts during the time within which
the murder was committed was both unsatisfactory
and entirely uncorroborated; four, that he attempted
to mislead officers of the law by means of an alibi
which he knew to be false; five, that in view of his
size, strength, length of leg, and the fact that every
one else for miles round appears to be accounted for,
he seems the most likely person; and six, that his
finger-prints were found on the wood-rasp with which
the deed was done.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Hastings, “if you were at the
inquest, what’s all the palaver about?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t, and you’ll see. Some of this I knew
already, some I guessed. Wonderful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Margaret leaned forward. “But who do you think
did do it, Mr. Gethryn? Do you suspect any one?”</p>

<p>“Every one in the world,” said Anthony. “Except
Deacon, you, James Masterson, and one other. But
I look first at the household; just as a matter of
interest like.” He ticked off names on his fingers.
“The butler Poole, the chauffeur Wright, Martha
Forrest the cook, Robert Belford the other
man-servant; Elsie Syme, Mabel Smith, housemaids; Lily
Ingram the kitchenmaid, and one Thomas Diggle,
gardener. Also the sister of the corpse, Sir Arthur
Digby-Coates, and Mrs. Mainwaring. And there we
have the ‘ ’ole ruddy issue, incloodin’ the ’eads.’ ”</p>

<p>“Shades of Pelman!” Hastings was moved to
exclaim.</p>

<p>“And,” said Anthony benignantly, “what about ’em
all? Their stories, their behaviour?”</p>

<p>Margaret consulted the notebook. “The servants,”
she said, “were all right. Most obviously all
right—except the man Belford. The girls no one could
accuse of murder, they’re too timid and their stories
were all connected enough. In most cases they fitted
in with each other naturally enough. The cook was
in bed before ten-thirty, and slept through the whole
thing. The chauffeur was talking to friends outside
the lodge. The butler was apparently in his little
room all the evening. He can’t prove it by witnesses,
but you couldn’t suspect an old man like that. He’s
not strong enough for one thing; and he’s obviously
dreadfully upset by the death of his master. Mrs.
Mainwaring seemed all right. She went to bed early,
and was seen there by both Miss Hoode and the maid
Smith—the one that was afterwards in the linen-room.
After the murder was discovered she was found fast
asleep. Sir Arthur Digby-Coates is quite all right.
He was in his own sitting-room—it has his
bedroom on one side of it and the secretary’s on the
other, apparently—from ten-fifteen until the body was
found by Miss Hoode and the old butler rushed up
and fetched him. During that time he was seen by
various people, including Deacon, at very short
intervals. As for Miss Hoode, she deposed—that’s the
word, isn’t it?—that she was in bed by half-past ten,
reading. At about eleven she suddenly remembered
something about an invitation to some one—she wasn’t
very clear in her evidence—and went downstairs to
use the telephone and to speak to her brother. After
that, well, you know what happened. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Anthony smiled. “And very good, too. I
congratulate you, Miss Warren. ‘So there, in a manner
of speaking, they all are.’ Of course, it’s all very
untidy, this evidence. Very untidy! Not at all neat!”</p>

<p>“I know, Mr. Gethryn. But then, you see, it
wasn’t as if they were all on trial. I mean, all this
about where they were and that sort of thing came
out mixed up with other things. It wasn’t
cross-examination with everything on the point and nowhere
else. And if people don’t know there’s going to be
a murder, they can’t very well all get up nice, smooth
alibis, can they?”</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. “Just what I said, Miss Warren.
They can’t. Now, about ferret-face—Belford, I mean.
You seem to think his evidence wasn’t as good as the
others’. What did he do? Or say?”</p>

<p>Hastings took up the tale. “Nothing very unusual
in itself. But his manner was all wrong. Too
wrong, I thought, to be merely natural nervousness.
Margaret thinks the same. It wasn’t that he said
anything one could catch hold of; he was just fishy.
He made rather a bad impression on the court too.
In fact, I think there’d have been a lot more of him
later if the case against your limpid-eyed pet hadn’t
come out so strong.</p>

<p>“Damn it all!” he went on, after a moment’s silence,
“in any other circumstances I’d be quite willing to
bow to your vastly greater experience, Gethryn. And
to Margaret’s womanly intuition and all that sort of
thing. But this is a bit too much. When you get
such a lot of circumstantial and presumptive evidence
as there is against this man Deacon and then add to
it the fact that his finger-prints were the only ones on
the weapon the other feller was killed with, it does
seem insane to blither: ‘<em>He</em> couldn’t have done it!
Just look at his <em>sweet</em> expression!’ and things like
that!”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” Anthony said. “But then Miss
Warren and I are <em>so</em> psychic, you see.”</p>

<p>“But the finger-prints, man! They——”</p>

<p>Anthony became sardonic. “Ah, yes! Those
eternal finger-prints. Hastings, you’re an incorrigible
journalist. Somebody says ‘finger-print’ to you, you
shrug—and the case is over. The blunt instrument
bears the thumb-mark of Jasper Standish, <i lang="la">ergo</i> Jasper’s
was the hand which struck down the old squire. It’s so
simple! why trouble any more? Hang Jasper!
Hang him, damn him, hang him!”</p>

<p>“But look here, that’s not——”</p>

<p>Anthony lifted his hand. “Oh, yes, yes. I know
what you’re going to say. And I know I’m talking
like a fool. The finger-print system is wonderful;
but its chief use is tracing old-established criminals.
If you consider the ingenuity exercised by this
murderer in everything else, doesn’t it strike you as queer
that he should leave the damning evidence of
finger-marks on only one thing, and that the actual weapon?
Why, he might as well have stuck his card on Hoode’s
shirt-front!”</p>

<p>Hastings looked doubtful. “I see what you’re
driving at,” he said, “but I’m not convinced. Not yet,
anyhow. And we’ve rather got away from Belford.
Not that there’s any more to say, really. He merely
struck us as being rather too scared.”</p>

<p>“What you really mean, I think,” said Anthony,
“is that in your opinion Belford was very likely in it
with Deacon.”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. “That’s got you, Jack. You
shouldn’t funk.”</p>

<p>Anthony said: “Let us leave ferret-face for the
moment. Was there no one else you thought behaved
suspicious-like?”</p>

<p>Margaret fingered the notebook in her lap.
Hastings looked at her.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t funk, Maggie,” he said.</p>

<p>“Pig!” said Margaret. “And <em>don’t</em> call me Maggie!
It’s disgusting!”</p>

<p>“What is all this, my children?” Anthony asked.</p>

<p>Margaret looked up at him. “It’s only that I told
this person that Miss Hoode made me uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“You’ve watered it down a good bit,” Hastings
laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, all I meant was that she seemed so
contradictory. Not in what she said, you know, but in the
way she looked and—and behaved. It was funny,
that feeling I had. At first I thought she wasn’t
suffering over her brother’s death, but was just worn
out with fear and with trying to—to hide something.
And then after that I began to think she was sorry
after all, and that all the queer things about her were
due to grief. And then after that again I sort of
half went back to my first ideas. That’s all. You
must think I’m mad, Mr. Gethryn.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Anthony, “that you’re a remarkable
young woman. You ought to set up in the street
of Baker or Harley, or both.” His tone was more
serious than his words; Margaret blushed.</p>

<p>“Did they,” asked Anthony, after a pause, “exhibit
the wood-rasp at the ’quest?”</p>

<p>Hastings nodded. “And a nasty weapon it must
have made, too.”</p>

<p>“I must get a look at it somehow,” Anthony said.
Then added, half-aloud: “Now, why does that mark
worry me?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing.” Anthony stretched himself.
“Enough for to-day, children. Hastings, there is a
lovely lady who wishes to visit your flat, and this
to-night. She is the sister of our old friend J.
Masterson. I promised she could see him if she went up
to town this evening.”</p>

<p>“Of course. J. Masterson, by the way, is all right.
Temperature much lower; though he’s very weak still,
of course. Does nothing but sleep. Doctor saw him
again this morning, and says his trouble is really
nothing worse than ’flu, aggravated by inattention and
complicated nervous thingumitights due probably to
shell-shock.”</p>

<p>“I see. It’ll be all right about his sister seeing him
this evening?”</p>

<p>“Of course.” Hastings’s smile was replaced by a
blank sort of look. “Er—by the way, if this lady
lives down here, perhaps I had—could drive her up now,
what?”</p>

<p>“I was going to ask whether you would,” Anthony
said, after a pause, “but I’ve changed my mind.
Don’t look too relieved.” His reasons for this sudden
change of plan were mixed; it is certain they were not
purely philanthropic.</p>

<p>“I gather, then,” said Hastings, “that having left
a competent subordinate to take down the dregs of the
inquest, the lady Margaret and I may now get back
to town.”</p>

<p>They descended to the waiting car. Before it began
to move,</p>

<p>“Miss Warren,” said Anthony, “would you be so
kind as to have that report of this morning’s
proceedings typed by some one and sent down to me here
to-morrow; it’ll be so much better than the public
ones.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it myself at once,” said Margaret.</p>

<p>The car moved forward. Anthony waved his
thanks, turned on his heel and re-entered the inn.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Within half an hour he was in Lucia’s drawing-room.
Outside the gate was his big red car.</p>

<p>Lucia kept him waiting barely two minutes. When
she came he noticed with irritation the schoolboyish
unruliness of his heart. There was for him some
new, subtle quality in her beauty to-day. Something
dark and wonderful and rather wild.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. “I heard the car. I
haven’t kept you waiting, have I?” she asked.</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head. She glanced curiously
round the room.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “Hastings hasn’t come. He had
to get back. That’s my car outside. If you’ll allow
me to, I’ll take you up to town now. If you’re ready,
shall we start?” He turned to the door.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said as he opened it, “that Mr.
Hastings couldn’t come. I wanted to have time to
thank him properly.”</p>

<p>Anthony, jarred, cheered himself with the thought
that there had been a laugh in her voice. He glanced
at her face. It told him nothing.</p>

<p>Her travelling-bag was carried out and placed in
the car.</p>

<p>“I’m driving myself,” said Anthony. “Will you sit
in front?”</p>

<p>She smiled at him and took the seat beside the
driver’s. Annoyed with the disturbance aroused in
his breast by that smile, Anthony drove out of the
gate and down the narrow road to the bridge at a
speed quite illegal. Then he slowed down, feeling not
a little ashamed. Another new sensation for Anthony
Ruthven Gethryn.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “Pace frighten you?”</p>

<p>She turned to him not the tense, white face he had
expected, but a joyous one, vivid with life under the
enchanting veil.</p>

<p>“Not a little bit,” she said; and laughter peeped
through her words. “You see, after yesterday—and
all that you did—I feel quite safe with you. As if
you couldn’t make a mistake. Not possibly!”</p>

<p>Anthony glowed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “Absolutely safe, that’s what I
feel.” A pause. “Just as a tiny girl feels if her
father takes her out, say, in a tandem.”</p>

<p>Anthony fell from heaven with a crash. Good
God! “Father!” So he had aroused an emotion akin
to filial, had he? Unfortunately for him, to drive a
car a man must keep his eyes on the road: he had not
seen the little half-smile of joyous mockery that had
accompanied that last thrust.</p>

<p>He drove on in silence, unbroken until Guildford was
reached. Here he had to slow to a crawl.</p>

<p>“Were you at Abbotshall this morning?” came in
a small meek voice from beside him.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“How did the inquest go? You see, I’ve heard
nothing, nothing! Was it—was it as bad as you said
it might be?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t there myself,” said Anthony, keeping his
eyes on the road ahead, “but from what I’ve been told,
I’m afraid it was.”</p>

<p>“But you said you <em>were</em> there.”</p>

<p>“At the house, yes. At the inquest, no.”</p>

<p>The small voice mocked him. “You do so love
being mysterious, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Touché!</i> I believe I do, you know. I’ve been
discovering a lot of youthful traits lately very ill in
accord with my age.” Something in his tone made her
look up at him from under the rakish brim of the little
hat. His profile showed grim; it seemed leaner than
ever.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I was inquisitive.” The small voice
was smaller and very meek.</p>

<p>Anthony started. “Good God! No! I didn’t mean
that. Look here, I’ll tell you. I went to Abbotshall
because I wanted to play burglars on the first floor.
And the best time to do it was when everybody was
downstairs at the inquest. See?”</p>

<p>“Of course. But how thrilling! Do go on. I
won’t tell a soul!”</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t known that,” said Anthony, “I wouldn’t
have said anything at all.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Did you find anything—that you
expected to find?”</p>

<p>“I found. Some of what I found I had expected
to find; some not.” His tone was final and silence
fell again. The big car’s speed increased. Soon they
were among London’s outskirts.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to stay?” Anthony asked.</p>

<p>“Brown’s Hotel. May I go there first, please?”</p>

<p>To Brown’s he took her, and waited with the car
till she reappeared. During the journey to Hastings’s
flat in Kensington there was little opportunity for
conversation. Once, threading skillfully through a press
of traffic, he began to whistle, under his breath, the
dirge of Cock Robin.</p>

<p>Then Hastings’s flat was reached. Introductions
over, they were left alone in Hastings’s study while
Hastings went to prepare the invalid.</p>

<p>Anthony picked up his hat. “I must go,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Back to Marling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Gethryn!” Lucia cried. “Did you only
come up to bring me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>“How awfully nice of you! But ought you to have
wasted all that time?”</p>

<p>“All pleasure,” Anthony said oracularly, “is gain.
Did you warn your sister that Deacon would probably
be arrested after the inquest?”</p>

<p>“I did. And I tried to persuade her not to worry.
So I obeyed orders, you see.”</p>

<p>“Did you believe there was no cause for worry?”</p>

<p>The great dark eyes met his. In their great depths
he saw little golden fires dancing.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>Anthony bowed. “Good-night,” he said, and was
gone.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>Chapter X. <br/> Birds of the Air</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>It was a few minutes after half-past four when
Anthony descended to the street and re-entered
his car. Through London he drove fast; clear of it,
terrifically. Always, when he found himself disturbed,
he sought consolation in speed. It was preferable to
be on a horse; but the car was better than nothing.
Besides, was there not work to be done?</p>

<p>On the journey he thought much. One half of his
mind was occupied with a problem of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>; the other
with a quantity more obscure even than <i>x</i>. It was that
second half of his mind which conceived doubts of the
worthiness of Anthony Ruthven Gethryn. The sensation
was new.</p>

<p>As he drove through the great gates of Abbotshall
and up the drive, the clock over the stables struck. A
quarter to six! If the distance from Kensington to
Marling is what they say it is, the word “terrifically”
was not misused.</p>

<p>He stopped the car. Round the corner of the house,
running, came Sir Arthur Digby-Coates. Though the
thick, gray-flecked hair was unruffled by the wind of
his speed, there was yet an agitation, a wildness about
him, his fluttering tie, his clothes, most unusual.</p>

<p>He panted up to the car. “Gethryn, Gethryn! Just
the man I was wanting! Where’ve you been?”</p>

<p>“London.” Anthony was almost surly. He had
been dreaming a dream.</p>

<p>“My God!” Sir Arthur pulled at his collar as if he
were choking. “Look here! I must talk to you.
But not here. Not here! Come in! Come in! My
room’ll be best. Come on!”</p>

<p>Anthony was dragged into the house and up the
stairs and into Sir Arthur’s room. They sat, in chairs
drawn up to the window. In his, Anthony lay back,
but the elder man hunched himself like a nervous
schoolboy, sitting on the edge of his chair with his feet
thrust backwards and then outwards until they
protruded behind and beside each of the front legs. It
was an old trick of his when preoccupied, and never
ceased to amuse Anthony.</p>

<p>It was some time before Sir Arthur spoke. He
seemed in his agitation to have difficulty in finding
words. His hands twisted about each other.</p>

<p>“God!” he burst out at last. “What <em>are</em> we to do?”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About this awful, this horrible mistake.” Suddenly
he jumped to his feet and stood over Anthony. “Why—is
it possible—haven’t you heard? About Deacon?”</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head.</p>

<p>“Why, man, they’ve arrested him! The coroner’s
jury passed a verdict against him. And the police
have arrested him. Arrested him!”</p>

<p>“Quite natural, when you think of it,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur stared at him. “D’you mean you think
he did it?” he roared. “That boy!”</p>

<p>“No. I’m sure he didn’t.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur sighed loud relief. “Thank the Lord
for that! But, Gethryn, how was it you hadn’t heard
about this? And if you hadn’t, how was it you weren’t
surprised? Weren’t you at the inquest?”</p>

<p>“Only roughly speaking,” said Anthony. “And I
wasn’t surprised because I knew on what evidence the
police were working. Pardon me if I seem flippant—I’m
not really—but what we’ve got to do is to find out
who really did kill Cock Robin. That’s the only way
of getting Deacon off. The police take Deacon to be
the Sparrow. You and I believe that he isn’t; but
we’ve got to admit that the case against him is good,
extraordinarily good. His size and strength fit the
part of the murderer. And above all his finger-marks
were found on the Bow and Arrow. That last will
want a deal of explaining, especially to an English
jury, who don’t, as a rule, know that real life’s more
like a fairy story than Hans Andersen.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” Sir Arthur groaned. “Those
finger-prints. He must have touched the—the—what
do they call the thing?”</p>

<p>“Wood-rasp. A file for wood.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. He—I suppose he <em>must</em> have touched it.
Must have. But I’ll swear the boy had nothing to do
with—with John’s death. And he said he’d never
seen the thing. And I believe him!”</p>

<p>“So he’d never even seen the thing,” Anthony said.
“Now that’s interesting. Most interesting!”</p>

<p>But Sir Arthur was not listening. “What I’m
feeling so—so damnably,” he burst out, “is that my
evidence helped to make things look worse for the boy.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Because they took mine first; and in describing
that awful night I mentioned, like the idiot I am, that
Deacon had come into my room at a quarter to eleven.
You see, he’d asked me the time, and I’d told him:
that’s what made me remember. Then later it all came
out about the clock in the study, and now every one
says the boy put the hands back because he knew he
had an alibi. Oh! It’s all a ghastly, horrible
mistake!”</p>

<p>“It is; and we shan’t mend it by sitting here and
talking.” Anthony got to his feet. “By the way,
before I go, tell me: what is Mrs. Mainwaring, who is
she, that this poor swine don’t see her? If it comes
to that, why is she here at all?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur made a wry face. “Why you haven’t
seen her I can’t tell. Why she’s staying here is, I’m
sorry to say, for the notoriety. Any decent person
would have left the house at once. I’m disgusted; I
used almost to like the woman. I would have left,
but Laura wished me to stay. And she’s so apathetic
that she won’t get rid of the Mainwaring.”</p>

<p>“I must see the lady,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur looked at him with curiosity, but found
no enlightenment.</p>

<p>“In fact,” said Anthony, “I must see both ladies.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur looked at him again, with no result.</p>

<p>“A last question,” Anthony said: “what—without
prejudice—do you think of the man-servant, Robert
Belford of the ferret face?”</p>

<p>“I wondered whether you’d ask about him,” Sir
Arthur said eagerly. “I didn’t like to say anything
because I really know nothing against him at all.
Never had anything to do with him, in fact. He used
to valet John, and would have me, only I don’t use
valets. It’s simply that I can’t bear the fellow; his
looks are enough to make any one suspicious. And
he’s been more furtive than ever—since the—the
murder.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” grunted Anthony.</p>

<p>“It’s really very ungrateful of me,” said Sir Arthur,
“to say anything against the man. He was one—or
really two—of the witnesses to the fact that I was
sitting here in this chair from ten until after—until
poor old John was found. But still, joking aside, I
have a very real feeling that Mr. Belford at least knows
more than he has told.”</p>

<p>“H’m. Yes,” Anthony said. “And now for Miss
Hoode. Where can I find her?”</p>

<p>“I think she’s downstairs somewhere, but I’m not
sure. I say, Gethryn, you’re not going to—to
cross-examine her, are you? I mean I don’t think she’ll
want a lot of talk about——”</p>

<p>“No,” Anthony said, crossing the room, “probably
she won’t.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur opened his mouth to speak; but was left
staring at the closed door.</p>

<p>As he shut it behind him, Anthony caught sight of
a black-clad figure disappearing round the corner by
the stairhead. It was a back he had seen before. It
wore an air of stealthy discomfort; and the speed
with which it had vanished was in itself suspicious.</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. “Belford, my friend,” he
thought, “if you <em>have</em> done anything naughty, you’re
simply asking to be found out.” He went on and down
the stairs.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>This evening, thought Anthony, as he stood facing
her by the open windows of the drawing-room, Laura
Hoode was even less prepossessing than she had seemed
on the day before. She had risen at his entry, and
though the thin, sharp-featured face was calm, he
somehow felt her perturbation.</p>

<p>She waved him to a chair. He sank into it, draping
one long leg over its fellow.</p>

<p>“What do you want of me, Mr. Gethryn?” The
voice was lifeless as the woman, and Anthony shivered.
The sexless always alarmed him.</p>

<p>“A great deal, Miss Hoode.” In spite of his
aversion his tone was blandly courteous.</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine——”</p>

<p>“Please—one moment,” said Anthony. “As you
know, I came down here to Marling to find out, if
possible, who killed your brother. A——”</p>

<p>“That task,” said the woman, “has already been
performed.”</p>

<p>“Not quite, I think. In my opinion, young Deacon
had no more to do with the murder than I. Each
minute I spend in this house increases my certainty.
This morning I found something I had been looking
for, something that may throw a light where one
is badly needed, something which you must tell me
about.”</p>

<p>She drew herself yet more upright on her
straight-backed chair.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gethryn,” she said, “I like neither your
manner nor your manners.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” said Anthony grimly, “neither
manner nor manners matter just now. Miss Hoode,
I started on this business half out of boredom, half
because a friend asked me to; but now—well, I’m
going to finish it.”</p>

<p>“But—but I don’t understand at all what you are
talking about.” The woman was plainly bewildered,
yet there seemed in her tone to be an uneasiness not
born of bewilderment alone.</p>

<p>Anthony took from his breast-pocket a thick packet
of letters. The paper was a deep mauve, the envelopes
covered with heavy, sprawling characters. The bundle
was held together by a broad ribbon, this too of deep
mauve. He balanced the little bundle in the palm of
his hand; then looked up to see white rage on the
bony, dull face of the woman. The rage, he thought,
was not unmixed with fear; but not the kind of fear he
had expected.</p>

<p>“These,” he said, “are what I want you to explain.
To explain, that is, who they are from, and why you
took them from your brother’s desk and hid them
again in your own room.”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet; moved a step forward.
“You—you——” she began, and choked on the words.</p>

<p>Anthony stood up. “Oh, I know I’m a filthy spy.
Don’t imagine that I think this private inquiry agent
game is anything but noisome. It has been nasty, it
will be nasty, and it is nasty, in spite of the cachet of
Conan Doyle. I know, none better, that to rifle your
room while you were at the inquest this morning was
a filthy thing to do. I know that brow-beating you
now is filthier—but I’m going to find out who killed
your brother.”</p>

<p>“It was that boy,” said the woman, white-lipped.
She had fallen back into her chair.</p>

<p>“It was not that boy. And that’s why I shall go on
thinking and spying and crawling and bullying until
I find out who it really was. Now, tell me why you
stole those letters.” He moved forward and stood
looking down at her.</p>

<p>An ugly, dull flush spread over her face. She sat
erect. Her colourless eyes flamed.</p>

<p>“You think—you <em>dare</em> to think <em>I</em> killed <em>him</em>?” she
cried in a dreadful whisper.</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head. “Not necessarily. I shall
know better what I think when you’ve told me what
I want to know.”</p>

<p>“But what have those foul scratchings to do
with—with John’s death?” She pointed a shaking finger
at the little package in his hands.</p>

<p>“Nothing, everything, or just enough,” said
Anthony. “You’re asking me the very questions which
I want you, indirectly, to answer.”</p>

<p>She said: “I refuse,” and closed tightly the
thin-lipped mouth.</p>

<p>“Must I force your hand?” he asked. “Very well.
You must tell me what I want to know, because, if you
don’t, I shall go to Scotland Yard, where I have some
small influence, and lay these letters and the story of
how I found them before the authorities. You must
tell me because, if you don’t, you will lead me to believe
that you do, in fact, know something of how your
brother met his death. You must tell me because, if
you don’t”—he paused, and looked at her until she
felt the gaze of the greenish eyes set in the swarthy
face to be unbearable—“because, if you don’t,” he
repeated, “the contents of these letters and their
implication are bound to become known to others beside you
and me. You will tell me because to keep that last
from happening you would do anything.”</p>

<p>Even as he finished speaking he knew that last shot
had told, fired though it had been in the dark. The
woman crumpled. And in her terror Anthony found
her more human than before.</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” she whispered. “I’ll tell. I’ll tell.”</p>

<p>Anthony stood, waiting.</p>

<p>“Did you read those—those letters?” The words
came tumbling from her lips in almost unseemly haste.</p>

<p>Anthony nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Then you must know that this <em>woman</em>—the <em>Thing</em>
that wrote them was John’s—John’s—mistress.”</p>

<p>Again he nodded, watching curiously the emotions
that supplanted each other in the nondescript face of
his victim. Fear he had seen and anxiety; but now
there were both these with horror, indignation,
tenderness for the dead, and a fervour of distaste for
anything which savoured of “loose living.” He
remembered what he had been told of the lady’s rigid
dissentingness, and understood.</p>

<p>She went on, more confidently now that she had
once brought herself to speak of “unpleasantnesses” to
this strange man who watched her with his strange
eyes.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, “nearly a year ago I found out
that John was—was associating with this—this woman.
I will not tell you how I found out—it is too long
a story—but my discovery was accidental. I taxed
my brother with his wickedness; but he was so—strange
and abrupt—his manner was violent—that I
had to leave him with my protest barely voiced.</p>

<p>“Afterwards I tried again and again to make him
see the folly, the horror of the sin he was committing—but
he would never listen. He would not listen to
me, to me who had looked after him since he left
school! And I was weak—sinfully weak—and I gave
up trying to influence him and—and tried to forget
what I had learnt. But those letters kept coming and
then John would go away, and I—oh! what is the
use——” She broke off, covering her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>Anthony felt a growing pity; a pity irrationally the
stronger for his own feeling of sympathy with the
dead man in what must have been a sordid enough
struggle against colourless Puritanism.</p>

<p>She dabbed at the red-rimmed eyes with a
handkerchief and struggled on.</p>

<p>“There is not much more to tell you except—except
that I—stole those letters for the very reason which
you used to—to force me to tell you about them. It
is wicked of me, but though John did sin, had been
living a life of sin, I determined to keep him clean in
the eyes of the world; to keep the knowledge of the
evil that he did from the sordid newspapers which
would delight in making public the sins of the man
they are lamenting as a loss to the nation. And he
is a loss to the nation. My poor brother—my
poor little brother———” She leant her head against
the back of her chair and wept, wept hopelessly,
bitterly. The tears rolled slowly, unheeded, down the thin
cheeks.</p>

<p>Anthony felt himself despicable. A great surge of
pity—almost of tenderness—swept over him. Yet the
thought of the great-bodied, great-hearted,
cleanly-sane man who was like to be hanged held him to his
work.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he asked, leaning forward, “the
name of this woman?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Her tone was drab, hopeless; she seemed
broken. “At least, I know that which she goes by.”</p>

<p>Anthony waited in some bewilderment.</p>

<p>“She is a dancer,” said the woman, “and shameless.
They call her Vanda.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” Anthony was startled into surprise.
He was a fervent admirer, from this side the
footlights, of the beautiful Russian. He reflected that
politicians were not always unlucky.</p>

<p>He got to his feet. The woman started into life.</p>

<p>“The letters!” she cried. “Give me the letters!”</p>

<p>He handed them to her. “My only stipulation,” he
said, “is that they’re not to be destroyed until I give
the word.” He looked at her searchingly. “I know
that you won’t attempt to be rid of them until then.
And please believe, Miss Hoode, that you have my
sincere sympathy, and that there will be no idle talk
of what we two know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe you,” she said wearily. “And now,
I suppose you are happy. Though what good you have
done Heaven alone knows!”</p>

<p>Anthony looked down at her. “The good I have
done is this: I have added to my knowledge. I know,
now, that you had nothing to do with your brother’s
death. And I know there is a woman in the business
and who she is. She may not be concerned either
directly or indirectly, but the hackneyed French saying
is often a useful principle to work on.”</p>

<p>The pale eyes of Laura Hoode regarded him with
curiosity. He felt with surprise that she seemed every
minute to grow more human.</p>

<p>“You are an unusual person, Mr. Gethryn,” she
said. “You spy upon me and torture me—and yet I
feel that I like you.” She paused; then went on:
“You’ll tell me that you know that the young man
Deacon did not kill my brother; you tell me that
although I have behaved so suspiciously you know also
that I had nothing to do with—with the crime. How
do you know these things?”</p>

<p>Anthony smiled. “I know,” he said, “because you
both told me. I know that neither of you did it as
you would know, after talking to him, that the bishop
hadn’t really stolen the little girl’s sixpence, even though
all the newspapers had said he did. Now I must go.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>He left Laura Hoode smiling, smiling as she had
not for many months.</p>

<p>As he entered the hall from the passage, a woman
rushed at him. She was tall, and suspiciously
beautiful. She drooped and made eyes. She was shy and
daring and coy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped. “Is it Colonel Gethryn? <em>Is</em> it?
Oh, you <em>must</em> be? Oh, Colonel, how <em>thrilling</em> to
meet you! How <em>too</em> thrilling!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Roland Mainwaring pleased Anthony not at
all. It is to be deplored that he was at no pains to
conceal his distaste.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mainwaring?” he said. “Madam, the thrill
is yours.”</p>

<p>She stood blocking his path. Perforce he stood still.</p>

<p>“Oh, colonel, <em>do</em> tell me you don’t think that <em>sweet</em>
boy—oh! the beastly police—it’s all <em>too</em>, too horrible
and <em>awful</em>!”</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. The thought of Deacon as a
“<em>sweet boy</em>” amused him. The lady regarded his
mirth with suspicion.</p>

<p>Anthony became ponderously official. “Your
questions, madam, are embarrassing. But my opinions
are—my opinions; and I keep them”—he tapped his
forehead solemnly—“here.”</p>

<p>Awe-stricken eyes were rolled at him. “Oh, colonel,”
she whispered. “Oh, colonel! How <em>won-derful</em>!”
Then, coyly: “How lucky for little me that I’m a
poor, weak woman!”</p>

<p>“I have always,” said Anthony gravely, “believed
in equal rights for women. They occupy an equal
footing with men in my—opinions.” He bowed and
brushed past her, crossing the hall.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch11">

<h2>Chapter XI. <br/> The Bow and Arrow</h2>

<p>Without a glance behind him at the beautiful
lady, Anthony make for the study, entered it,
and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>The great room bore an aspect widely different from
that of his first visit. Down the centre ran the long
trestle table of the coroner’s court. Two smaller ones
were ranged along the walls. The far end of the room
was blocked with rows of chairs.</p>

<p>Anthony realised, with something of surprise, what
a vast room it was. Then he banished from his mind
everything save his immediate purpose, and turned to
the little rosewood table which stood between the door
and the grandfather clock.</p>

<p>He bent to see more clearly the scar on the table-top,
the scar which he had noticed on his second visit to
the room and which had, in some vague way he could
not define, been persistently worrying him during the
day. It was an even more perfect impression of the
wood-rasp than he had remembered it to be, an orderly
series of indentations which made a mark two inches
wide and nearly a foot in length.</p>

<p>That something kept jogging in his mind; something
about the mark that was indefinably wrong because
the mark itself was so undoubtedly right.</p>

<p>Beside him the door opened. He straightened his
back and turned to see Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Gethryn. Can I come in? Thought you
might be in here. Turn me out if you’d rather be
alone.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Anthony. “Come in. I’m here
because I wanted to look at something and because it
was the best way of escape. What sweetness! I feel
quite sticky, I do!”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur smiled. “Dodo Mainwaring, eh? I
caught a glimpse of her. What d’you think?”</p>

<p>Anthony raised one eyebrow.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Sir Arthur. “If that woman
doesn’t go soon I won’t wait for Laura, I’ll pack her off
myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” Anthony said vaguely, looking down at
the table. “I say, have you seen the Bow and Arrow?”</p>

<p>“Eh? What?”</p>

<p>“The wood-rasp.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur shivered. “Oh, yes. Yes, I have. It
was an exhibit at the inquest.”</p>

<p>“What was the size of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe it’s about the biggest made. Usual
short, thick handle with a blade of about a foot long
and perhaps two inches wide.”</p>

<p>Anthony pointed to the table. “Did it make this
mark?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course. Why, all that came out at the inquest.
Weren’t——”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” cried Anthony, and slapped his thigh.</p>

<p>“What’s that? What’s that? Have you thought—found
something?”</p>

<p>“I have and I have. Now, another thing: was the
handle of the thing old and battered and worn at the
edges and filthy and split?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur smiled. “No; I’m afraid you’re wrong
there, Gethryn. It was almost brand-new.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” said Anthony. “Exactly. All polished
and convenient. Oh, ours is a nice case, ours is!”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, I’m afraid you go too fast for me.”
Sir Arthur was puzzled.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” Anthony said. “I go a damn
sight too fast for myself sometimes.”</p>

<p>“But what are you driving at? What’s all this
about the wood-rasp?”</p>

<p>“I won’t give you a direct answer—it’s against the
rules of the Detectives’ Union—but I invite you to
bring your intellect to bear on the position of this
scar here. You’ll see that it’s roughly twelve inches
by two and lies ten inches from all four edges of the
table—right in the middle, in fact. Then think of
the nice new handle on the wood-rasp.” Anthony
appeared well pleased. “ ‘O frabjous day, Calloo
callay!’ Rappings from Doyle!”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur shook his head. “I suppose you’re not
mad?” he said, smiling.</p>

<p>“ ‘No, not mad, said the monkey.’ ”</p>

<p>There fell a long silence, broken at last by the elder
man.</p>

<p>“God!” he cried in a whisper. “Let’s get out of
this room. Gethryn, it’s horrible! Horrible! Where
poor old John was killed—and here we are cracking
jokes and laughing!” He took Anthony by the arm
and pulled him to the door.</p>

<p>They went into the garden through the verandah.
By the windows of the study Anthony stopped and
stood staring at the creeper-covered wall; staring as
he had stared on the afternoon before. Sir Arthur
stood at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Splendid sight, that creeper,” said Anthony.
“<i lang="la">Ampelopsis Veitchii</i>, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“So you’re a botanist? It may be what you say.
I’m afraid it’s just creeper to me.”</p>

<p>Anthony, turning, saw Boyd walking towards them,
and waved a hand.</p>

<p>“Damn!” Sir Arthur growled. “The Scotland
Yard man. He arrested the boy. Officious fool!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Boyd’s a good chap. I like Boyd. He’s done
his best. On the evidence he couldn’t do anything but
take Deacon.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” said Sir Arthur impatiently.
“But all the same, he——” He broke off, turning
to go.</p>

<p>Boyd came up to them. “Good evening, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Evening, Boyd,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>Suddenly, “By Gad!” Sir Arthur cried, and turned
a bewildered face upon them. “I didn’t think of that
before!”</p>

<p>“Think of what, sir?” asked Boyd.</p>

<p>“Why, something that may change everything!
Look here, that’s the window of my sitting-room up
there— the one over the window of the study which
you say the murderer must have got in by!”</p>

<p>Anthony was silent. Boyd said stolidly: “Well,
sir?”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, man? Don’t <em>you</em> see, Gethryn?
I was sitting up in my room, by that window, all the
time. I should have been bound to hear something.
Bound to!”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t, sir,” said Boyd.</p>

<p>“Ach!” Sir Arthur turned on his heel and flung
away from them and into the house.</p>

<p>“He’s very upset because he thinks you’ve taken the
wrong man, Boyd,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“I know, sir. Do you?”</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. “I do, I do. By the way, can
I see him?”</p>

<p>“You can, sir. He asked for you. That’s really
what I came up for. That and the walk.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’ll take you down in the car. How long
before Deacon’s moved to the county jail?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be going to-morrow sometime, sir.
Afternoon or evening.”</p>

<p>They walked in silence to the car. Anthony drove
out of the gates and down the hill very slowly. Boyd
sighed relief: he knew “the colonel’s” driving of old.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, sir,” he said at last, “that this case
has been a disappointment to you, so to speak.”</p>

<p>Anthony looked round at him. “Why so fast,
Boyd? Why so fast?” After a moment he added:
“Pumps not working too well to-day, are they?”</p>

<p>The detective gave a rumbling chuckle. “I suppose
it was a bit obvious, sir,” he said. “But you’re
puzzling me, that you are.”</p>

<p>“What am I that I should flummox one of the Big
Four? Oh, Fame! Oh, Glory! I stand within your
gates.”</p>

<p>Boyd reddened. “Oh, don’t josh, sir. What I
mean is, here are we with as clear a case as ever
there was, and yet there are you, a gentleman who’s
no amateur, still searching around and—and trying to
make another criminal, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a bit of good trying to get me to explain
what I’m doing, Boyd, because I don’t know myself.
I’m groping—and it’s devilish dark. There is a little
light, but I don’t know where it’s coming from—yet.
But I will.” He fell silent; then added in a different
tone: “Look here: we’ll take it that I’m mad and that
the law is sane. But will you help me in my madness?
Just one or two little things?”</p>

<p>“As far as I can, sir,” Boyd said solemnly, “of
course I will.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good fellow, Boyd,” said Anthony
warmly, “and you can start now.” He stopped the
car and turned in his seat. “Where’s the Bow—I
mean the wood-rasp?”</p>

<p>“At present it’s at the station. Where we’re going.
To-morrow it’ll be taken up to the Yard.”</p>

<p>“Can I see it this evening?”</p>

<p>“You can, sir, seeing that you’re an old friend,
if I may say so.”</p>

<p>“Excellent man!”</p>

<p>“Look here, sir,” Boyd took a wallet from his
pocket; from the wallet some photographs. “You
might care to see these. Enlargements of the
finger-prints.”</p>

<p>Anthony took the six pieces of thin pasteboard and
bent eagerly to examine them. They had been taken,
these photographs, from three points of view. They
showed that the handle of the rasp had been marked
by a thumb and two fingers—all pointing downwards
towards the blade.</p>

<p>“And these were the only marks?” Anthony said.</p>

<p>“Enough, aren’t they, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Anthony. “Oh, yes. What
lovely little marks! How kind of Archibald!”</p>

<p>“What’s that, sir?”</p>

<p>“I was remarking, Boyd, on the kindly forethought
which Mr. Deacon showed for Scotland Yard. He
couldn’t bear to think of you wasting your time
detecting all the wrong people, so he left his card for you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re getting at at all, sir.”
Boyd shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>Anthony handed back the photographs and started
the car. In less than a minute they had finished the
descent and turned the corner into the village of
Marling. Boyd caught his breath and clung to his
seat. The High Street streamed by them. At its far
end Anthony pulled up, outside the little police station.
Marling was proud of its police station, an offensive
affair of pinkish brick. To Anthony, coming upon it
in the midst of the little leaning houses, the low-browed
shops and thatched cottages, it was like finding a
comic postcard of the Mother-in-law school in an
exhibition of pleasing miniatures.</p>

<p>He shivered, and dragged Boyd inside. Here he
was received by the local inspector. At a word from
Boyd the inspector produced keys, opened locks and
at last laid on the table the wood-rasp.</p>

<p>It was, as Sir Arthur had said, the biggest of its
kind—a foot-long bar of serrated iron, looking like
a file whose roughnesses have been ten times
magnified. To the points of these roughnesses clung little
scraps of stained and withered flesh, while in the
corresponding hollows were dark encrustations of dried
blood. The handle was new, of some light-coloured
wood, and was perhaps four inches long and three
and a half in circumference.</p>

<p>“Now that’s not at all pretty,” said Anthony, with
a grimace. “Can I pick it up? Or would that
spoil the marks?”</p>

<p>Boyd said: “Oh, that’s all right, sir. The
coroner’s jury have passed it about. And we’ve got
the official record and the photos.”</p>

<p>Anthony took it from the table; peered at it; shook
it; weighed it in his hand.</p>

<p>Boyd pointed to the blade. “Not much doubt that’s
what did the trick, is there, C—Mr. Gethryn?”</p>

<p>“Never a doubt,” said Anthony, and shook the thing
with vigour.</p>

<p>There was a sudden clatter. The blade had flown
off, struck the table, and fallen to the floor.</p>

<p>“Bit loose,” said Anthony, looking at the handle in
his fingers.</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up the blade, holding it
gingerly.</p>

<p>“Those blows that broke in the deceased’s skull,”
said Boyd, “must’ve been hard enough to loosen
anything, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“Possibly.” Anthony’s tone was not one of
conviction. “Aha! Now what are you doing here, little
friends?” He picked, from a notch in the thin iron
tongue upon which the handle had been fitted, two
threads of white linen. “And you, too, what are
you?” He stopped and picked up from the floor a
small, thin wedge of darkish wood. “There should be
another of you somewhere,” he murmured, and peered
into the handle. He shook it, and there dropped out
of the hollow where the tongue of the blade had been
another slip of wood, identical with the first.</p>

<p>He turned to the two men watching him. “Boyd,
I give these, the threads and the woods, into your
official keeping. You and the inspector saw where
they came from.” He took an envelope from his
pocket, slipped his discoveries into it and laid it upon
the table beside the dismembered rasp.</p>

<p>The inspector looked at the man from Scotland
Yard, and scratched his head.</p>

<p>“That’s all, I think,” Anthony said. “Can I see
the prisoner now?”</p>

<h2>Chapter XII. <br/> Exhibits</h2>

<p>The door of the cell clanged to behind Boyd.
From a chair, Deacon unfolded his bulk to greet
Anthony. They shook hands.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t long before I yelled for you,” the criminal
grinned. “Take the chair. I’ll squat on the gent’s
bedding.”</p>

<p>Anthony sat, running his eye over the cell. There
was the chair he sat on, the truckle bed, a tinware
wash-stand, a shelf, a dressing-case of Deacon’s, and,
in one corner, a large brown-paper parcel.</p>

<p>“Pretty snug, brother, isn’t it?” Deacon smiled.
“I languish in comfort. ’D’ve been pretty glad of
this at times during the recent fracas in France.
I say, wouldn’t you like to write the story of my
life? <i>Some Criminals I have Known: Number One—The
Abbotshall Murderer.</i> You know the sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>Anthony laughed. “Well, you take it easily enough.
I’m afraid I should alternate fury and depression.”</p>

<p>For a moment Deacon’s blue eyes met his; and in
them Anthony saw a kind of despairing horror. But
only for the half of a second. And then the old
laughing look was in them again. More than ever,
Anthony felt admiration and a desperate desire
to get this large man out of this small cell; to make
him free again—as free as the hot, gleaming streak
of the setting sun which pierced the little barred
window and painted a broad line of gold upon the drab
floor. But to get him out one must work.</p>

<p>“What about those finger-prints?” he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“You have me,” said Deacon, “on the hip. That’s
the most amazing bit of jiggery pokery about all this
hocus pocus. What about ’em to you?”</p>

<p>“They certainly savour,” Anthony said, “of hanky
panky. In fact, since I know they’re yours and that
you didn’t kill Hoode, I know they must be. Now,
have you seen that wood-rasp?”</p>

<p>“Yes. At the inquest.”</p>

<p>“Never before?”</p>

<p>“Not as I knows on, guv’nor. In fact, I’d almost
swear to ‘never.’ But then I’m the most amazing ass
about tools. A fret-saw or a pile-driver, they’re all
one to me.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice the handle?” Anthony asked.</p>

<p>“With interest; because they said it had my
paw-marks on it.”</p>

<p>“Ever seen that before? By itself, I mean.”</p>

<p>Deacon shook his head. “Never.” He fell silent,
then said: “I suppose those prints <em>couldn’t</em> be any
one else’s, could they?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they couldn’t,” said Anthony. “You
see, it’s as near proved as a thing like that can be
that no two men have the same markings on the
fingers. They compared those on the wood with those
on the bit of paper Boyd got you to hold, and their
experts don’t make mistakes. By the way, I
suppose you realised at the inquest how you’d been
caught?”</p>

<p>Deacon smiled. “Not at the inquest, brother, but
at the time. I’ve read too many spot-the-murderer
serials in my time not to know what a sleuth’s up to
when he hands me a bit of paper and asks me whether
I ever saw it before. But I didn’t mind at the time,
you see, not knowing about that blasted file thing.
I say, Gethryn, are we mad? Or is this all a bloody
nightmare? I tell you, I didn’t kill the boss, and yet
the thing he’s killed with is all over the marks of my
fingers! And as far as I know I never even saw the
gadget before! It doesn’t work out, does it?”</p>

<p>“It’s got to,” Anthony said. “I’ll damned well
make it. Now, what d’you know about the
incomparable Vanda?”</p>

<p>Deacon whistled. “How did you get hold of that?”
he asked, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“You know my methods, my dear Deacon. But
what d’you know about Vanda? Beyond the fact that
she’s the most wonderful dancer of all time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t really <em>know</em> anything; but I’ve a shrewd
little suspish that she was the boss’s mistress.”</p>

<p>“She was. But as you didn’t actually know
anything, I gather you can’t help me further there.”</p>

<p>“ ’Fraid not. For one thing my suspicion was
founded on something that happened by accident, and
for another I’ve not the foggiest idea of what you’re
driving at.”</p>

<p>“They <em>will</em> all say that!” Anthony sighed. “And
it’s just what I want some one to tell <em>me</em>. Never
mind, we’ll get on with the exhibits. Have you ever
seen this?” He took from a swollen hip pocket a
small paper package, unfolded it, and handed the
contents to Deacon.</p>

<p>They were a coil of filthy, black-smeared silk cord.
Curiously, the prisoner shook it out, letting one end
fall to the floor. He saw now that it was knotted at
regular intervals along its length, which was a full
sixteen feet.</p>

<p>“Never saw it in my natural.” He looked up at
Anthony. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Obviously a length of silk cord,” Anthony said,
“with, as you would probably say, knobs on.”</p>

<p>“I mean, where did you find it? What bearing’s
it got?”</p>

<p>“I found it,” said Anthony slowly, “in your bedroom
at Abbotshall.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“In your room. On a ledge inside that wonderful
old chimney; about six inches higher than the
mantelpiece. That accounts for the filth. You can see the
rope was white once, and not so long ago.”</p>

<p>Deacon frowned at the floor. “Well, it’s either been
there up the chimney since I went to the house—last
May, that is—or else it’s been planted there. I never
set eyes on it before.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Anthony coiled up the cord, wrapped it up
in the paper, and returned the parcel to his pocket.</p>

<p>“But what’s the beastly bit of string <em>mean</em>? What’s
it got to do with me or you or anything in this business?
Tell me that!”</p>

<p>“Shan’t,” said Anthony. “I’m not sure yet myself.
You’ll have to wait.”</p>

<p>Deacon shrugged his great shoulders. “Right-o.
Next, please.”</p>

<p>Anthony’s hand went to his breast pocket. From
a leather wallet he took a bunch of newspaper
cuttings.</p>

<p>“These,” he said, “I found in a really-truly secret
drawer in your late chief’s desk. Know anything
about ’em? Or why they were there?”</p>

<p>In silence, Deacon read each slip. When he had
finished,</p>

<p>“Well?” Anthony said.</p>

<p>“They mean nothing in my young life. These
three rags—<i>The Searchlight</i>, <i>The St. Stephen’s Gazette</i>,
and the weekly one, <i>Vox Populi</i>—always were dead
agin the boss. I can’t make head or tail of what you’re
driving at, Gethryn, I can’t really!”</p>

<p>Anthony groaned. “There you go again. Never
mind that, but tell me, did you know Hoode was
keeping these cuttings?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever mention the persistent attacks of these
three papers?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“No? Pity.” Anthony got to his feet. “I must
move. Anything you want? Books? Food?
Tobacco?”</p>

<p>Deacon smiled. “Nothing, thanks awfully. Our
Arthur—old Digby-Coates, you know—has done all
that. Brought me down a sack of books, a box of
cigars, and arranged for decidedly improved victuals
to be brought over from the White Horse by quite a
neat line in barmaidings. Also, he’s fixed up the
solicitors and trimmings. They’re going to try to
get Marshall, K.C.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! Marshall’s about the best counsel there
is. There’s nothing you want, then.”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Shall I see you to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. “You will. Early afternoon,
probably, as I hear they’re moving you later.
Good-night; and don’t forget I’m going to get you out of
this—somehow.”</p>

<p>They shook hands. A minute later Anthony was
walking slowly back towards his inn up the cobbled
street. The sun was sinking behind the gables of a
twisted house at the top of the rise, and the road which
had been gold was splashed with blood-red blotches.</p>

<p>He shivered. In all this morass of doubt and
wilderness of evil—a wilderness wherein innocent men
had obviously committed crimes they had nothing to
do with, where every one was sure except Anthony
Ruthven Gethryn—he felt alone. Not even the
golden-dark background to his thoughts which was the
perpetual image of the Lady of the Sandal could
compensate for the blackness of bewilderment—the
blackness through which he could see light but not yet
the way to light.</p>

<p>Then his thoughts turned to Deacon, his cheerfulness,
his ease of manner, his courage which surely
masked a hell of distress. Suddenly the admiration
which he felt somehow cheered him. His step
quickened.</p>

<p>“By God!” he muttered, “that’s a man and a
half——” and broke off sharply. He had collided
with something softly hard. A girl, running. A
girl with wild, red-rimmed eyes and hatless,
dishevelled, golden head.</p>

<p>Before he could voice apology; almost before he
was aware of the collision, she had passed him and
was stumbling down the uneven little road with its
splashes of crimson painted by the dying sun. From
a doorway a slatternly woman peered out, curious with
the brutal, impersonal curiosity of the yokel.</p>

<p>Anthony struggled to adjust his memory. Ah,
yes! It was the sister. Her sister. Dora Masterson.
He turned; caught up with four long strides; laid a
hand upon the girl’s shoulder. She shook it off,
turning to him a face disfigured by desire for more
tears, tears that would not come.</p>

<p>“You were going to the police-station, Miss
Masterson?” Anthony asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t—not like this.” He took her gently
by the arm. “You could do nothing—and you’d
make him feel as if things were unbearable.”</p>

<p>“I must see him.” She spoke dully, an unnatural
pause between each word.</p>

<p>“Not now,” said Anthony firmly. “Not when I
want your help.” He wondered if the lie showed
through his words; cursed that he should have to
hamper himself with an hysterical girl.</p>

<p>She swallowed the bait. “Help you?” she asked
eagerly. “About—about Archie? How can I do
that?</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you here. You must come up to the
inn.” He led her back up the hill.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br/> Irons in the Fire</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Up in his little, low-ceilinged, oak-panelled
sitting-room in the Bear and Key, Anthony sat the
girl in the one arm-chair. She refused whisky so
pleadingly that he ordered tea. When it had come
and the bearer departed, he sat on the table and watched
her drink.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “suppose you tell me all about
it,” and was immediately smitten with very fragrant
memories of another occasion when he had used that
phrase.</p>

<p>Dora Masterson said simply: “I was frightened.
Oh, so horribly, <em>horribly</em> frightened!”</p>

<p>Anthony was puzzled. “But why just now?
Surely you must have felt like this as soon as you
heard?”</p>

<p>“N-no. Of course it was—terrible! But Lucia
told me what you said, Mr. Gethryn—and she—she
seemed to so absolutely <em>believe</em> that you would make
everything all right that I—I tried to believe too.”</p>

<p>Anthony’s heart gave a leap that startled him.</p>

<p>The girl went on, struggling for control. “But—but
it was when I heard about the end of the inquest—that
he was actually in—— Oh, it’s too awful! It’s
too <em>terrible!</em>” She swayed about in the big chair,
hands hiding her face, the slim shoulders twisting as
if her pain were bodily.</p>

<p>Again was Anthony puzzled. Something in the
tone told him that here was something he had not
heard of. And this tendency to hysteria must be
stopped.</p>

<p>“What d’you mean? Explain!” he said sharply.</p>

<p>She sat upright at that, her face working. “I mean
that—that—if only I hadn’t been a senseless, vicious
little fool; if—if only I hadn’t be-behaved like a
b-beastly schoolgirl, Archie wouldn’t—wouldn’t be in that
awful place! Oh! why was I ever born!” She
pressed her hands to her face and doubled up in the
chair until her forehead rested on her knees.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand yet,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>She raised her head. “Weren’t you at the inquest?”
she asked, dabbing at her swollen eyes with the back
of a hand like the schoolgirl she had named herself.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said Anthony, and wondered how
many more times he would have to answer this
question.</p>

<p>“Why, then you—you don’t know that—that Archie
s-said he went out for a walk during the time when
the—the Thing must have been done. And the <em>beasts</em>
d-don’t believe him because nobody at all saw him while
he was out!”</p>

<p>“I still don’t——”</p>

<p>She broke in on his sentence with a flood of speech,
springing to her feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, you fool, you fool!” she cried. “<em>I</em> ought
to have seen him! <em>I</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>I!</em> <em>I</em> was to have met him
down there on the bank, this side, by the bridge.
We’d arranged a walk! And then because <em>I</em> thought
<em>I</em> was some one; because <em>I</em> thought he had been rude
to <em>me</em> that afternoon, I must needs think <em>I</em> would
punish <em>him</em>! And I didn’t go! I didn’t meet him!
I stayed at home! Christ help me, I stayed at home!”</p>

<p>Anthony was shocked into sympathy. “My <em>dear</em>
chap,” he said. “My <em>dear</em> chap!” He went to her
and dropped a hand on her shoulder. “You poor
child!”</p>

<p>Wearily, she sank against him. The reddish-golden
head fell on his shoulder. But she made no
sound. She was past tears.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood thus, while he patted the
slim shoulder. Then she drew herself upright and
away from him.</p>

<p>“You must sit down,” he said.</p>

<p>She looked up at him. “Please forgive me,” she
said. “I didn’t mean to—to make such a fool of
myself. And I was very rude.” She sat down.</p>

<p>Anthony waved aside apology. “What we’ve got to
do,” he said, smiling down at her, “is to do something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know. But what, what? Oh, you
said I could help, but I believe you only did it out of
kindness. But if I could really help—how much less—less
filthy I should feel!”</p>

<p>Anthony conceived a liking for this girl; a liking
born not altogether of sympathy. But he wondered,
with half-humorous desperation, how he was to
provide the cleanser and yet not waste much time.</p>

<p>“Consoler-in-Chief to the Birds of the Air, I am,”
he said to himself; then aloud: “You can help,
Miss Masterson, by listening to me think. In this
business, I’m like a mad poet without hands or tongue.
I mean, I’ve found out more than the other fellows—the
police—but it’s all odds and ends and tangles—little
things, queer in themselves, that men would tell
me might be found anywhere if one only troubled to
look for ’em. But I say they’re not; that they fit!”</p>

<p>The girl was sitting upright now, alert, gazing at
him intently. “Think, then,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Now for it,” thought Anthony, “and God send
it’ll take her in—and quickly.”</p>

<p>Aloud, he began: “Reconcile for me—put these
things into order and make ’em mean something—if
you can. Innocent finger-prints on a weapon which
performed a murder. An innocent person—not the
one of the finger-prints—stealing letters from the
corpse to hide the fact that the corpse had a mistress.
An attempt to make a clock give an alibi, the attempt
being so clumsily carried out that it seems very ill in
accord with other indications of the murderer’s
ingenuity. Secret drawer in corpse’s desk full of
newspaper-cuttings, all of ’em vicious attacks on corpse
when alive. Finger-prints——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gethryn!” the girl interrupted harshly; “you’re
making fun of me! No, that’s not fair; you’re just
playing with me to make me think I can help. No
doubt you mean to be kind—but I <em>hate</em> it!”</p>

<p>Anthony for once was crestfallen. The truth of
the accusation was so complete as to make an answer
impossible. He found himself in the indefensible
position of one “who means well.” He groped wildly
for words, but was saved; for, suddenly, Dora sprang
to her feet.</p>

<p>“Those cuttings!” she cried. “Did you mean—do
you <em>really</em> want to know anything about them?”</p>

<p>Anthony was surprised. “Most certainly I do. I
don’t know exactly what I want to know, but that
means I want to know everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, go and see Jim—my brother—now, at once!”
She stamped her foot at him in her excitement.
“When he was secretary to Mr. Hoode he was full of
those attacks in the press. I remember we thought
he was rather silly about them. He used to say there
was something more than mere—what did he call
it?—policy behind them, and swore he’d make Mr. Hoode
take notice of them. I <em>think</em> it was what they
eventually quarreled about, but I’m not sure, because
he’d never tell me. He wouldn’t even tell Loo—my
sister. But if you want to know anything about those
papers, Mr. Gethryn, Jimmie’s more likely to be able
to tell you than any one else!”</p>

<p>Anthony looked at her and said: “The best apology
I can make to you is to go up to town now. Your
brother ought to be well enough by this time. He’s
got to be!” He paused; then added with a smile:
“You know you wouldn’t have found me out if I’d
been less preoccupied. I’m a bit tired, too.”</p>

<p>Dora, forgetting herself, looked at him closely.
“Why—why, you look almost <em>ill</em>!” she cried, “p’r’aps
you—oughtn’t to go to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going right enough,” Anthony said; “and
now. And I’m not ill; that’s only my interesting
pallor. You must go home—and don’t worry.”</p>

<p>She cried: “How can I <em>help</em> worrying? Worrying
till I wish I’d never been born! Unless there’s
a miracle——”</p>

<p>“Chesterton once wrote,” Anthony interrupted her,
“that ‘the most wonderful thing about miracles is that
they sometimes happen.’ And he’s a great and wise
man.”</p>

<p>The girl flashed a tremulous smile at him and
passed out of the door.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>At ten minutes past ten the great red Mercedes
drew up outside the block of flats where Spencer
Hastings lived. Anthony had broken his own record
of that afternoon for the Kensington-Marling journey.</p>

<p>Stiffly, he clambered to the pavement, noted with
curiosity that his hands were shaking, and ran up the
steps. As he went he wondered would he see Her.
He arrived at the door of No. 15 more out of breath
than the climb should have made him.</p>

<p>Wonderfully, it was She who opened it, and at her
smile the shortness of his breath was foolishly
increased. For the smile was one, it seemed, of open
delight at seeing him.</p>

<p>Hastings, she told him, was out, being at his office.
His housekeeper, too, was out, being on holiday. But
wasn’t Mr. Hastings a dear? Wasn’t Mr. Hastings’s
betrothed a charming betrothed? The invalid was
ever so much better; temperature down; sleeping; in
fact, almost all right. And she hadn’t forgotten how
everything, everything was due to the sagacity,
kindliness, and general wonderfulness of Mr. Gethryn!</p>

<p>They were by this time in the little drawing-room;
and as yet Anthony had done nothing save stare with
all his eyes. She finished speaking, and he realized that
he must say something. But what? He wanted to
shout to Heaven that he hadn’t seen her for hours
longer than years. He wanted to catch her hands—those
long, slim hands—and cover them with kisses.
He wanted to tell her that she was most glorious of
women and he the vainglorious fool who dared to love
her. He wanted—oh, what did he not want?</p>

<p>He said: “Er—good evening. Hastings out?”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes at him. “But—but, Mr.
Gethryn, I’ve just told you that Mr. Hastings is at his
office!”</p>

<p>“Of course. Ah, yes,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Did you want to see him?”</p>

<p>Anthony recovered himself; remembered that he had
work to do, and that by attending to it he could save
himself from behaving foolishly.</p>

<p>“No,” he said shortly. “Mrs. Lemesurier, I must
see your brother.” It was, he thinks now, the great
fatigue which had accumulated during the past days
and the strain of that flying drive which led him to
speak with such curtness.</p>

<p>“To see Jim? Oh, but you can’t,” Lucia said.
Her tone was gentle and rather aloof and very firm.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I must,” Anthony said. His loss of
temper is regrettable, and was inexplicable to himself
even at the time.</p>

<p>The dark eyes blazed at him. “You can’t,” she
said.</p>

<p>Anthony said with brutal clearness: “Mrs.
Lemesurier, I am, as best I know how, trying to clear of
the charge of murder a man I believe innocent. I’ve
got to a point where a five minutes’ conversation with
your brother will help me. Your brother—you have
told me yourself—cannot be considered as seriously ill.
I must see him.”</p>

<p>This time it was her eyes that fell. Anthony was
angry—with himself. And a man angry with himself
is invincible.</p>

<p>With a grace that burned a picture into his mind she
crossed the room, to stand with her back to the door.</p>

<p>Anthony picked his hat from the table and walked
slowly towards her, smiling as he walked. It was not
a nice smile. It was a smile which crept up on one
side of his face and stopped before it reached his eyes.
A black smile. There are men in odd corners of the
world who would counsel, out of personal experience,
that when one sees that smile one had better get out.</p>

<p>He came close to her, still smiling. For a moment
she faced him; then faltered; then stood to one side and
let him pass.</p>

<p>He closed the door softly behind him and began
his search for the sick-room. He found it at once.
He entered, closing this door even more softly.</p>

<p>A shaded lamp arranged to leave the bed in shadow
was the only light. In the bed lay a man. Peering
at his face, Anthony could trace a certain faint
resemblance. He sat on the chair by the bed and waited.</p>

<p>“What the devil are you?” said a weak voice.</p>

<p>Clearly, but with rapidity, Anthony explained his
presence.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said in conclusion, “to disturb a
sick man, and I’ll get the business over as quickly as
possible. But I’ve got to find out all I can, you see.”</p>

<p>“Quite, quite.” Masterson’s voice was stronger
now. Free of fever, shaven, clean, he was vastly
different from Margaret’s bogey.</p>

<p>“How can I help?” he asked after a silence.</p>

<p>Anthony told him. Bored at first, Masterson woke
to sudden interest at the mention of the
newspaper-cuttings.</p>

<p>“So he <em>did</em> keep ’em!” He lifted himself in the
bed to rest on one elbow.</p>

<p>Anthony pushed the little bundle of slips into the
thin hands. Eagerly, the sick man read each.</p>

<p>“Some of these are new,” he said. “After my time
with Hoode, I mean. But these three—and this one—I
remember well. Dammit, I ought to! These are
what we had that infernal row about.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I’d been watching these three papers
for a long time, and I’d come to a definite conclusion
that there was one man behind all the attacks. I told
Hoode so, and he laughed at the idea! That made
me as mad as hell. I’ve always had a foul temper, but
since the war, y’know, it’s really uncontrollable. I
mean I actually can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s all. I cursed him for a blind, pig-headed,
big-headed fool, and he sacked me. He couldn’t very
well do anything else. I still feel very bitter about it;
though not quite so much now he’s dead. He was
such a brilliant cove in some ways, but so blasted silly
in others. Simply wouldn’t listen to what I had to
say—and I was sweating to benefit him!”</p>

<p>“ ‘Zeal, all zeal, Mr. Easy!’ ” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Exactly; but zeal’s a damn good thing at times,
’specially in private secretaries, and being turned down
like that made me brood. I really couldn’t help it,
you know. After I got the sack I brooded to such an
extent that I simply went to pieces. Drank too much.
Made an idiot of myself. I say, Lucia’s told me all
about things, and I want to thank——”</p>

<p>“You can do that best,” Anthony interrupted, “by
keeping on about Hoode and these press-cuttings.
I’ve made some conclusions about ’em myself, but you
know more.”</p>

<p>A slight flush rose to the sallow cheek of the man
in bed. He turned restlessly.</p>

<p>“When I come to think of it,” he said nervously,
“I don’t <em>know</em> a great deal. “Mostly surmise, and from
what I’ve heard of you I should say you’re better at
that game than I am.”</p>

<p>Anthony grew grim. “Some one’s been exaggerating.
You fire ahead. The sooner you do, the sooner
I’ll be able to get away and leave you in peace.”</p>

<p>Masterson said hesitantly: “All right. When I
first saw the things coming out one by one I didn’t
think anything about ’em. But after a week or so—it
may have been a month—something queer struck me.
At first I couldn’t place it. Then after collecting a
few of the articles, I tumbled. It seemed to me that
one man was behind ’em. More, that one man was
writing ’em—and for three papers of widely different
politics and apparently belonging to different people!”</p>

<p>Anthony was pleased. “You support me. I
thought the author seemed to be one man, though I’ve
not had time to study the things carefully. I went
so far as to think—the authorship being the same and
the papers so different in views—that one man
controlled all three.” He fell silent a moment, then added
slowly: “One might consider, you know, whether the
controller and the writer——”</p>

<p>But Masterson interrupted. “Look here,” he said,
sitting up in obvious excitement, “how did you spot
the unity of authorship business?”</p>

<p>“Similarity of style, I think.” Anthony was
reflective. “I’ve got quite an eye for style. Two or three
times the fellow tried to disguise it. By doing that
he gave the game away completely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but there was more than that!” cried the
other, fumbling with shaking hands at the sheaf of
cuttings. “Wait till I find—ah! Now, look at this.
‘The Minister of Imperial Finance, in his efforts for
advancement of self, would do well to remember that
hackneyed line of Pope: “A little learning is a
dangerous thing.”’ Did you see that?”</p>

<p>Anthony opened his eyes. “I did. And thought
how refreshing it was to see the quotation given right.
They nearly all get it wrong, though you’d think any
one could see that Pope couldn’t have been such a
fool as to say a little knowledge was dangerous.
Knowledge is always useful; learning isn’t—until
you’ve got plenty. But go on: what about it?”</p>

<p>Masterson was searching feverishly. “Tell you
when I’ve found—here we are! Listen. Er-um
Finance—policy—rumty-tumty—‘when Greek joins
Greek, then comes the tug-of-war!’ There you are
again. How many times d’you see that given right?”</p>

<p>“Never,” said Anthony. “They all say ‘meets.’ ”</p>

<p>“There you are, then. It all goes to prove what
you felt and I’m certain about.” He tapped the bundle
of cuttings with a lean finger. “All these were written
by the same man; there’s not a doubt in my mind.
Style—similarity in style, I mean—isn’t proof; but
this orgy of correctitude <em>plus</em> that similarity is. At
least it’s good enough for me. There are plenty
more instances if you want them. There’s one I
remember well—a leader in <i>Vox Populi</i>. It was a
more vicious attack on Hoode even than the others,
and it was so damn’ well done that it was almost
convincing. It said, apropos of him: ‘<i lang="la">facilis
descensus averno</i>.’ What about that?”</p>

<p>Anthony sat up. “ ‘<i lang="la">Averno</i>’ is very rare,” he said
slowly. “But it’s a better reading. I saw it. I
wondered. I wondered a lot.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. The two looked at each other.</p>

<p>“Masterson,” Anthony said at last, “you’re very
useful, you know. Most useful. Wish you weren’t
sick a-bed. Now here’s another point. We’ve fixed
the author of these articles as one man; but what about
the motive force behind the author. I’m inclining to
the view that as these papers differ so widely in
everything else they are controlled by some one whose only
interest in them was to do Hoode a bad turn. Agree?”</p>

<p>Masterson nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>“Right.” Anthony leaned forward, speaking softly.
“But did this motive force hire some one to write
for it, or was its distaste for the unfortunate Robin
Hoode so great that it wrote itself, being unwilling
to forgo the pleasure of, so to speak, giving birth to
a new litter of scorpions three times a month or more?
Briefly, are you with me in thinking that author and
motive force are probably one and the same?”</p>

<p>“By God, I am!” Masterson said.</p>

<p>Anthony smiled. “Well, thank God I’ve found
another lunatic! That’s what we are, you know. Think
of our theory! It is that some one had such a hatred
of Hoode that the secret purchase of three newspapers
was needed to assuage it. That’s what we’ve said;
we’re thinking more. But we’re frightened to say
what it is because it’ll sound so silly.”</p>

<p>“I know. I know.” Masterson’s tone was almost
fearful. “I say, we <em>can’t</em> be right! It isn’t sense!
Now I come to think of it there are dozens of other
theories that’d fit. There might be more than
one person. The whole thing might be political.
The——”</p>

<p>Anthony raised a hand for silence. “Fear not.
Of course you can fit other theories. One always
can; that’s the devil of this bloodhound business.
The only way to work is to pick a likely-looking path
and go down it. I’ve chosen one to get on with.
As you say, it’s not sense; but then nothing else is.
It’s sad and bad and very mad and very far from
sweet. But there it is. So we’ll all go mad. I’m
starting now.” He got to his feet.</p>

<p>“Here, wait a minute!” Masterson cried. “Don’t
go. I—I might be able to help you.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you have already—immeasurably!
For one thing you’ve crystallised my determination to
go mad and stay mad——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know all about that!” Masterson exhibited
some irritation. “But I mean really help. I was
just going to tell you. When I was with Hoode,
before I told him about this business, I went to one
of those filthy private inquiry agents. I was so
absolutely certain, you see. I told this chap to find out,
if he could, who the enemy was. Or rather I told
him to find out who really owned the three newspapers.
He thought I was mad, said he could do it in a day—but
he didn’t! I think he imagined he’d only got to
look it up or get some one from Fleet Street to tell
him. Of course, that didn’t work, he only gave me
the three figureheads that’re shown to the trusting
world. But when I laughed at him, and explained a
little, I think he got his back up and really went for
the job.”</p>

<p>“D’you mean to say——” began Anthony.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t! Before I heard any more I had the
row with Hoode—I didn’t tell <em>him</em> about the ’tec, of
course; I was too angry—and dropped the whole
business and paid this chap off. He was very fed
up—kept trying to see me, and writing. Of course—well
in the state I was in, I refused to see him and chucked
his letters into the fire. But he was so very eager!
He <em>might</em> know something, I think!”</p>

<p>Anthony was elated. “He might indeed.
Masterson, you’re a treasure! What’s the name?”</p>

<p>“Pellet, he calls himself. Office is at 4, Grogan’s
Court, off Fleet Street, just past Chancery Lane.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! Now I’m going.” Anthony held out
his hand. “And thank you. Hope I’ve done you no
harm.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Feel better already. Let me know how
you get on. Going to sleep now,” said the invalid,
and did, before Anthony had reached the door.</p>

<p>In the passage, Anthony hesitated. Should he go
straight from the flat or should he tell Her first that
he was going? Then, as he reached it, the door of
the drawing-room opened.</p>

<p>The passage was dimly lit, and at first she did
not see him. He moved towards her. There came
a startled “Oh!” of surprise; then she straightened
herself into a rigidity eloquent of protest. Anthony
groaned. He had hoped the ruffled feathers smooth
again.</p>

<p>“Your brother,” he said, “is asleep. By the look
of him he’s in for a good twelve hours. He’s none
the worse and I’m even more full of information than
I’d hoped to be. So everything in the garden is
lovely!”</p>

<p>But Lucia was angry. Lucia was not to be put
off by this light-and-airyness. When she spoke her
voice was cold; cold and cruel. She meant to
hurt—and succeeded.</p>

<p>“Is there nothing,” she said, “that my brother and
I can help you with further? Nothing that we can
be <em>made</em> to do? A woman and a sick man! Oh,
surely there is?”</p>

<p>For the second time that night Anthony lost his
temper. One must, to a certain extent, forgive him.
He was worried and tired and harassed and very
much in love. He laughed, and peered down at her in
the half-light. Lucia caught her breath. Like many
lesser women she had, being angry, said far more than
she had meant. And now she was sorry, and—well,
yes, frightened.</p>

<p>“Before I go,” Anthony said, “I will tell you a story.
Once on a time there was a woman who had a big
brother and a little sister. One night, she heard that
her big brother, who was living in the great city, was
sick with a chill. Good friends had taken him to their
house and were caring for him. But the woman
posted to the great city to make sure that her brother
was indeed being well tended.</p>

<p>“But,” he went on, “she left behind her in the
country her little sister. Now, this maid was in great
sorrow, for her lover had been seized by all the king’s
horses and all the king’s men and thrust into a dungeon.
Here he was to stay until the king’s judges had decided
whether or no to hang him for a misdeed of which
he had not been guilty. So, left alone, the little sister
grew more and more lonely and frightened, and
became in danger of falling ill, She had nobody to
comfort her, you see. But that, of course, did not
matter, because big brother had his mustard plaster
in the right place at last.”</p>

<p>He walked to the front-door; opened it. “Good
night,” he said, and shut it gently behind him.</p>

<p>Hands gleaming pale against her throat, Lucia leant
against the wall of the passage.</p>

<p>Down in the street, Anthony jumped into his car;
then for a moment sat staring before him. Like
many lesser men, he had, being angry, said more than
he had meant. And now he was frightened.</p>

<p>They had, it must be admitted, behaved like silly
children. Very silly children. But then the best
people so often do.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br/> Hay-fever</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>After that one moment of introspection,
Anthony headed his car for Fleet Street. At
twenty-five minutes past eleven he burst into the room
of <i>The Owl’s</i> editor.</p>

<p>The editor and his secretary were rather close
together. The shining golden hair of the secretary was
noticeably disordered.</p>

<p>“Er—hallo!” said Hastings.</p>

<p>Anthony said: “Get hold of private ’tec called
Pellet; 4, Grogan’s Court. Find out what he knows
about the ownership of <i>The Searchlight</i>, <i>The St.
Stephen’s Gazette</i>, and <i>Vox Populi</i>. He was
commissioned for same thing some time ago by J.
Masterson. Never mind how much he costs. I’ll pay. If
Pellet doesn’t know anything, find out yourself. In
any case give me the answer as soon as is damn’ well
possible. Got that? Right. ’Night. ’Night, Miss
Warren.” The door banged behind him.</p>

<p>Margaret Warren snatched some papers from her
table and followed. She caught him in the entrance
hall.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gethryn!” she said, breathless. “Here’s the
report—asked—for—inquest.—Just finished—typed.
You may—want it.”</p>

<p>Anthony raised his hat. “Miss Warren, you’re
wonderful.” He took the papers from her hand.
“Many thanks. Hope I don’t seem rude. Very busy.
Good-night—and good luck.” He shook her hand
and was gone.</p>

<p>Slowly, Margaret went back to her editor. He was
found pacing the room, scratching his head in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Yes, darling, he was a bit strange, wasn’t he?”
Margaret said.</p>

<p>“He was.” Hastings spoke with conviction. “I’ve
known that man for fifteen years and I’ve never seen
him all hot and bothered like that before. He’s
usually calmest when he’s got most to do.”</p>

<p>Margaret patted his cheek. “But, you silly baby, he
wasn’t like that because of the work he was doing.
It was something much, much more important than
that—or I’m a Dutchman!”</p>

<p>Hastings was alarmed. “Not that! Anything but
that! What was it, then?”</p>

<p>“A woman, of course. <em>The</em> woman! Heaven, am
I tied to an idiot?”</p>

<p>“Just you wait, wench, until I’ve seen Mr. Pellet!”
said Hastings.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>From Fleet Street, Anthony drove straight to the
Regency, over whose great frontage flaring placards
and violently winking electric signs announced that the
great, the incomparable Vanda was gracing with her
art this mecca of vaudeville. As he reached it the
audience were streaming out from its great glass doors.</p>

<p>He anticipated difficulty, and approached the
stage-door keeper with a five-pound note and broken
English. He was, it seemed, Prince Nicolas
Something-or-the-other-vitch. He was oh! so great a friend of
the great, the incomparable Vanda—even a relation.
He <em>must</em>, it was of an imperativeness, see her.
Further, the good keeper of the door really must accept
this so little piece of paper.</p>

<p>The good keeper did; then proceeded laboriously to
explain that the Vanda was not in the theatre. Hadn’t
been there at all that day. <em>And</em> there ’adn’t been half
a row about it, neither! She had wired to say she
couldn’t appear. Why? Gawd perhaps knew; certainly
nobody else did. When would she reappear?
The keeper of the door reely couldn’t say. P’r’aps
to-morrer. P’r’aps never. Good-night to <em>you</em>, sir.</p>

<p>Anthony went to his flat, surprised his man, and
ordered a drink, a bath, fresh clothing, a drink, and
supper.</p>

<p>At the meal, his hunger surprised him. Then he
remembered that since the lightest of lunches he had
eaten nothing. Having made up the deficiency, he lit
a cigar, sat in a chair by the open window and read
through, not once but many times, the typed report of
the inquest.</p>

<p>Somewhere a clock struck two. Anthony put down
the report, clasped his head with his hands, and plunged
into thought. Presently he found his mind to be
wandering, strictly against orders—wandering in a
direction forbidden. He swore, got to his feet, and
crossed to the writing-table. At this he employed
himself with pen and paper for more than an hour.</p>

<p>At last he put down his pen and read through what
he had written. The clock struck four. He finished
his reading, said: “H’mm! Those blasted gaps!”
and went to bed.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>He had barely two hours’ sleep, for by a quarter
past six he was breaking his fast. At twenty minutes
past seven he was driving his car slowly through
London.</p>

<p>This morning he took the journey to Marling
slowly: the pointer of his speedometer touched
eighteen as he left the outskirts of town, and remained
there. For Anthony was thinking.</p>

<p>For the first third of the journey his thoughts were
incoherently redundant. They were of a certain scene
in which A. R. Gethryn had lost his temper; had
behaved, in short, abominably, and this to the one person
in the world for whose opinion he cared.</p>

<p>It cost him an effort greater than might be supposed
to wrench his thoughts out of this gloomy train, but
at last he succeeded.</p>

<p>This puzzle of his—some of it fitted now, only there
were several idiotic pieces which, unfitted, made
nonsense of the rest. He flogged his unwilling brain for
the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>He backed the Mercedes into the garage of the Bear
and Key at twenty-five minutes to ten. By five minutes
to the hour he was walking with his long, lazy stride
up the winding drive of Abbotshall.</p>

<p>Drawing near the house he saw that the great oaken
door stood open, letting a shaft of hot, clean, morning
sunlight paint a golden track across the polished floor
of the wide hall. He entered, flung his hat on to a
chair, and turned in the direction of the stairs.</p>

<p>He had set foot upon the third step when from
behind and below him came a noise—a rasping roar
of a noise. To his overtired brain and overheated
imagination it seemed a noise evil and inhuman. He
swung round. The hall was as he had left it, empty
of all save furniture. He descended the three steps;
stood looking about him; then walked towards the
front door. Before he could reach it, the noise came
again, louder this time. The same roaring, rasping
sound. But this time it had for a tail a snuffling choke
which came, obviously, from the throat of a man.</p>

<p>Anthony laughed at himself. Noiselessly, he
retraced his steps, passed the foot of the stairs, and
halted outside the door opposite that of the study. It
stood ajar, giving him a glimpse of the little room
which he remembered as being the lair of the butler.</p>

<p>Anthony waited. In a moment came the roar again,
now recognisable as half-cough, half-sneeze. Anthony
pushed the door wide. Facing it, huddled in a chair,
was the butler. His gray head was on a level with
his knees. In one claw of a hand he clutched a
bandanna handkerchief with which he dabbed every
now and then at his streaming eyes.</p>

<p>Anthony stood unmoving in the doorway. Presently,
another spasm shook the old man.</p>

<p>“Bad cold, that,” Anthony said loudly.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The coughing gasps went
on; gradually grew less frequent. The thin shoulders
ceased to shake.</p>

<p>“Bad cold, that,” said Anthony again.</p>

<p>This time he got an effect. Poole leapt to his feet,
fumbling hurriedly to hide in a tail pocket the capacious
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, sir!” he gasped. “Did you want me,
sir?”</p>

<p>“I only remarked that yours was a bad cold.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Thank you. Not that it’s a cold,
sir, exactly. It’s this hay-fever. And very
troublesome it is, sir, for an old fellow like me!”</p>

<p>“Must be.” Anthony was sympathetic. “D’you
have these attacks many times a day?”</p>

<p>“I used to, sir. But this summer it does seem to be
improving, sir. Only takes me every now and then,
as you might say.” The old man’s voice showed
gratitude for this concern about his ailment.</p>

<p>But Anthony’s interest in hay-fever was not yet
abated. “This the first bad fit you’ve had for some
time?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Quite a while since I was so bad, sir.
It didn’t trouble me at all yesterday, sir.”</p>

<p>Anthony drew nearer. “D’you happen to remember,”
he said slowly, “whether you—er—sneezed like
that at all on the evening your master was killed?”</p>

<p>Poole exhibited agitation. “Whether I—the
master——” the thin hands twisted about each other.
“Forgive me, sir—I—I can’t remember, sir. I’m a
foolish old fellow—and any mention of—of that
terrible night sort of seems to—to upset me, sir.” He
passed a hand across his forehead. “No, sir, I really
can’t remember. I’m an old man, sir. My memory’s
not what it was. Not what it was——”</p>

<p>But Anthony was listening no longer. He was, in
fact, no longer there to listen. He had suddenly
turned about and sprung into the hall. As Mr. Poole
said later in the servants’ hall: “I’d never of believed
such a lazy-looking gentleman could of moved so quick.
Like the leap of a cat, it was!”</p>

<p>Had he followed into the hall, he would have had
more matter for gossip. For by the door of the
verandah Anthony stood clutching, none too gently,
the skinny shoulder of Robert Belford—the
man-servant he had christened “Ferret-face.”</p>

<p>“A word in your pointed ear, my friend,” he said,
and tightened his grip. “Now where shall we chat?
The garden?” He pulled his trembling captive, whose
face was a dirty gray with fear, out through the
verandah, and on to the terrace.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” Anthony said, dropping his hand,
“suppose you tell me why in hell you listen to my
conversations with other people.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t listening.” The man’s voice was sullen,
yet at the same time shrill with fear.</p>

<p>“Why take the trouble?” Anthony asked plaintively.
“Besides, it’s wicked to tell stories, Belford. Wicked!
Unhappy is the burden of a fib. We will, I think, get
farther from our fellows and you shall tell me all
about everything. I’ve been watching you, you
know.”</p>

<p>With these last words, true but intentionally
misleading, a black shadow of hopelessness seemed to fall
upon the prisoner.</p>

<p>“All right,” he mumbled wearily, and followed
meekly, but with dragging feet, while his captor led the
way down the steps and across the lawn and into the
little copse which faced the eastern end of the house.</p>

<p>As he walked, Anthony thought hard. He was
something more than mystified. What in heaven,
earth or hell was this little person going to tell him?
Another old boot turning into a salmon, what?
Father Gethryn, confessor! Well, every little helps.</p>

<p>When the house was hidden from them by the trees,
he stopped. He sat on a log and waved Belford to
another. Then he lit his pipe and waited. To his
surprise, the little servant, after clearing his throat,
began at once. Much of his nervousness seemed to
drop from him, though he still looked like a man in
fear.</p>

<p>“I’m rather glad this has happened, sir,” he said,
“because I was going to come to you anyway.”</p>

<p>“You were, were you?” thought Anthony. “Now
why?” But he went on smoking.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t of stood it much longer, sir, reely I
couldn’t! And ever since you stopped that great brute
of a sergeant from popping it across me, sir, I’ve been
tryin’ to make up me mind to tell you.” He paused
as if expecting an answer; but getting none, plunged
on. “I wasn’t upstairs <em>all</em> the time that night, like I
said I was at the inquest!” Again he paused.</p>

<p>Anthony went on smoking. Here, if he wanted
the story quickly, silence was best.</p>

<p>Belford swallowed hard. His face, as he went on
speaking, turned from muddy gray to dead white.</p>

<p>“I—I come downstairs, sir, after I’d finished in the
master’s room. And when I got to the ’all I heard
old Poole starting on one of them sneezin’ fits.
And—and, sir, I went into the study and I saw the master
lyin’ there on the rug—just like they found ’im!
And—and I shut that door behind me quick—old Pooley
was still coughin’ and chokin’ his head off—and I
nipped back up the stairs, sir. It’s God’s truth, sir!
It is——”</p>

<p>This time the pause was so long that Anthony knew
speech necessary.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to explain,” he said, “that though
you did go into the study that night you didn’t have
anything to do with the murder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, yes.” The man’s eagerness was pathetic.
“That’s just it, sir! I didn’t have nothink to do with
it, sir, <em>nothink!</em> So ’elp me God!”</p>

<p>“What did you go into the room for?” Anthony
shot out the question. “Must’ve been for something
you didn’t want found out or Poole’s hay-fever wouldn’t
have been so important to you?” The logic, he knew,
was faulty. But the thrust told.</p>

<p>Belford hung his head. “Yes, sir, it was what you
say. I thought—one of the girls told me—the
master was in the billiard-room. And I knew as ’e
always kept money somewhere in the study. I was
goin’ to pin—steal it if I could. I was desprit, sir.
Desprit!”</p>

<p>Anthony was puzzled. “But if you came out
without stealing anything, why didn’t you rouse the house
when you saw Mr. Hoode was dead?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. Except that it all come as such
a shock like—my sneaking in there while old Poole
was sneezin’—and then finding—that, sir. You see,
when I nipped out, the old man was still sneezin’ with
’is ’ead on his knees. And I <em>knew</em> as he hadn’t
spotted me. And I bolted away to think. An’ the
more I thought, the more I feels as if I
couldn’t—hadn’t better like—tell anybody.</p>

<p>“I can see, now, sir, ’ow blasted silly it were—me
having done nothink wrong. But there it was, sir,
I meant to tell, but as I’d gone in there to steal
and ’ad sneaked in in the way I did—well, it made
me feel as if they’d all jump on me immediate as the
murderer. Specially as I never goes into the study
in the ordinary way. You <em>do</em> see ’ow it was, don’t
you, sir?”</p>

<p>“It do,” Anthony said. “But I also see that you’re
a fool. A fool for not rousing every one at once;
a fool for not keeping quiet after you’d decided to
say nothing about it.”</p>

<p>Belford’s little eyes opened wide. “But you—you
were on me, sir! You suspected me like—thought
I was the murd’rer!”</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head. “Not really, Belford.
You know, you looked too guilty to be true. I
nabbed you just now because I don’t like
eavesdroppers. Also because anything fishy in this house
interests me at present.”</p>

<p>“I may be a fool,” cried Belford in heavy tones
not without humour, “but I feel better now I’ve got
it off my chest like. Reely I do, sir! I kept sayin’
to meself as how I wasn’t guilty of anythink, and
yet I ’ad the conscience awful! I’ve bin trying to tell
you for twenty-four hours, sir, but when I ’eard you
askin’ Poole if ’e’d ’ad a ’tack of that hay-fever on
the night the master was killed, I got frightened again
and was goin’ to bolt. Only you copped me.” He
was silent a moment, then burst out: “Mr. Deacon
didn’t do it, sir. He couldn’t of! You know that,
sir?”</p>

<p>Anthony did. But he wanted to turn this
tragi-comic confession of nothing into evidence of
importance, though he had but little hope of success.</p>

<p>“What time,” he asked with affected carelessness,
“did you go into the study?”</p>

<p>“I was only just in and out like a flash, sir. But
when I got back to the stairs, the clock there said
five past eleven, sir—I remember it perfect. I wasn’t
lookin’ for the time reely, only some’ow I saw it and
couldn’t forget it like.”</p>

<p>Anthony repressed elation. “Thanks,” he said, and
got to his feet.</p>

<p>Belford jumped up. “Are you—going, sir?”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>“But what—what are you goin’ to—to do about
me? About what I told you, sir?”</p>

<p>Anthony looked down benignly. “Nothing.”</p>

<p>Belford’s mouth fell open. “Nothing! <em>Nothing?</em>
But——”</p>

<p>“What I mean, Belford, is this. I’ll keep you out of
trouble. You’ve told me one thing that makes all your
confession of nothing worth while. You may, later on,
have to give evidence; but that’s the worst you’ll have
to do as far as I’m concerned. And don’t worry. And
for the Lord’s sake don’t walk about as you’ve been
doing lately, looking like Charles Peace with a
bellyache.”</p>

<p>The little man smiled all over his wizened face.
Anthony looked at him curiously. Somehow, when
talking to him as a man and not a servant, one found
something so far from being sly as to be almost
lovable.</p>

<p>Anthony gave the narrow shoulders a reassuring
pat and strolled away, making for the house. He
had covered perhaps twenty yards when he stopped,
turned on his heel, and walked back.</p>

<p>Belford was seated again on his log. His face
was buried in his hands. Anthony stood looking
down at him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>The other dropped his hands with a cry, bounding
to his feet.</p>

<p>“I—beg your pardon, sir. You—I——”</p>

<p>Anthony soothed him. “Steady, man, steady.
Take your time. Lots of it.”</p>

<p>Belford looked up at him, tried to speak, failed,
and hung his head again.</p>

<p>“Just now,” Anthony said, “you told me
something about being desperate. What is it? Money?”</p>

<p>Belford nodded. “You’re right, sir,” he muttered.
“It’s—it’s my wife, sir. Been very ill, she has.
And is still. I was goin’ to ask the master to ’elp me;
but when it come to the point, I couldn’t. That’s
why I was after pinchin’, sir. I would ’ave asked ’im,
I would reely, sir; but I knew he’d ask Miss Hoode
about it, and that’d ’ave made it ’opeless. You see,
sir, the missus was in service here before we was
married—and, well, sir, she ’ad—’ad to leave in a nurry.
And through me! You understand, sir—our
nipper——” He broke off, looking up appealingly.
“We’re very fond of each other, sir,” he finished.
“And it’s ’ard to see ’er so ill like!”</p>

<p>“How much d’you want?” Anthony felt for his
note-case. “Here, you’d better have twenty now.
And I’ll fix you up properly to-morrow. Now, for
God’s sake, man, pull yourself together!” he added
sharply.</p>

<p>For Belford’s shrivelled, sharp-featured little face
was working in a way which was not good to see.
Gratitude is sometimes more terrible to watch than
baser emotions.</p>

<p>Anthony thrust the notes into one limp hand and
beat hurried retreat.</p>

<p>Belford stood where he was left. His lips moved
soundlessly. The banknotes in his hand crackled as
the stubby fingers clenched upon them. Presently he
raised his head and looked with blurred vision along
the path through the trees.</p>

<p>“Gawd!” he said, the refinement of the servants’
hall now completely gone. “Gawd! What a bloke!
What a <em>bloody</em> good bloke!”</p>

<p>Anthony took the terrace steps three at a time.
He was elated. The elation was short-lived; before
he had reached the house, despair had taken its place.
After all, this playing at detectives was foolery. Why,
such a day as this, with its hot, clean peace, its
drowsiness, its little scented breeze—was it not a day for
a lover to lie at the feet of his mistress? Was it not
a day for hot, sun-warmed kisses?</p>

<p>He shook himself, laughing bitterly. “Affectioned
ass!” he said to himself.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur came out of the house. “Lovely day,
Gethryn. Early, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“It is and I am. I am also a detective of the
greatest. Do I look it?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur grew eager. “What d’you mean?
Have you got anything? Found out anything
important?”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. “Yes, twice.”</p>

<p>“But what, man? What?”</p>

<p>“One, the butler suffers from hay-fever. Two, the
murder was committed at as near eleven o’clock as I
am to you.”</p>

<p>“Damn it all, Gethryn,” said the elder man, “I don’t
think it’s quite fair to pull my leg like that. Not
about this. I don’t really!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, it isn’t. I’m sorry.” Anthony was
contrite. “But you know, I’m not as silly as I sound.
You must think I’m telling you things you knew before;
but I’m not really. What I think these things mean,
I’m not going to say just yet. Not to any one.”</p>

<p>“I see. That’s all right, Gethryn. You must
forgive me if I seem touchy.” Sir Arthur smiled
forgivingly.</p>

<p>“Seen Deacon lately?” Anthony asked.</p>

<p>“This morning. In fact, I’ve just come back.
He’s wonderful, that boy!”</p>

<p>“He is,” agreed Anthony. “I’m just going to see
him now. Walk to the gate with me, will you? I
want you to help me.”</p>

<p>“My dear chap, with pleasure!” He put his arm
through Anthony’s as they walked.</p>

<p>“I want to know,” said Anthony, as they reached
the end of the house, “whether any one in any way
connected with the household does any playing about
with carpenter’s tools. Amateurs, professionals, or
both.”</p>

<p>“Funny you should ask that, Gethryn? I’ve been
thinking about that. But it’s no help. You see, the
place is full of ’em—carpenters, I mean. There’s
Diggle, the gardener, he’s really an excellent rough-job
man. Then there’s the chauffeur, he made that shed
over there—and a splendid bit of work it is. And
John, well, it was his one hobby as it is mine. You
know that set of three small tables in the
drawing-room?”</p>

<p>“I did notice them. They puzzled me rather.
Couldn’t place ’em.”</p>

<p>“John made those,” said Sir Arthur, with a touch of
pride, “nearly twenty years ago. I remember I was
very jealous at the time. I couldn’t ever have done
anything so good, you see. I was a bit better than he
at the finer sorts of work, though.” He broke off,
seeming to fall into a reverie. After a while he added:
“No, Gethryn, I’m afraid this line’s no good to us.
That wood-rasp doesn’t belong to Abbotshall.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?” Anthony asked.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t mine, it didn’t belong to John, it isn’t
Diggle’s—he was questioned by the police, you know—and
it certainly isn’t the chauffeur’s.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Anthony seemed annoyed.</p>

<p>They walked on to the gate in silence. Anthony
nodded an adieu and set off down the white, dusty road
with his long horseman’s stride.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br/> Anthony’s Busy Day</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>He covered the distance to the village in a time
creditable for so hot a day. As he passed the
Bear and Key, a knot of men stopped their conversation
to eye him with thirsty interest. He smelt reporter
and passed by, giving silent thanks to the efficiency of
Boyd. Now that the case seemed, to the public at
least, as good as over, there was no real danger; but
had the news-hungry hordes been let loose at first to
overrun Abbotshall, Heaven alone knew how
impossible things would have been.</p>

<p>For the case of the murdered minister had seized
violently on public imagination. It was so like, so
very like, the books the public had read yesterday,
were reading to-day, and would read to-morrow and
to-morrow. Great Britain (and Ireland) was divided
now into two camps—pro and anti-Deacon. The
antis had a vast majority. Many of them held that
to waste time on a trial which would be purely formal
was disgraceful. The wretch, they said, should be
hanged at once. Not a few were convinced that
hanging was too merciful. It was all very funny, really,
thought Anthony, and wished he could laugh. But
whenever he tried to realise how funny it was, he
thought of Deacon, and then found that it wasn’t
funny at all, but rather terrible.</p>

<p>On this morning, though, he was at least on the
road to high spirits, and walked on down the twisting,
cobbled street towards the police-station, whistling
beneath his breath. The whistle bewailed the cruel death
of Cock Robin.</p>

<p>Still whistling, he ran up the steps of the
police-station. As he passed through the doorway the
whistling stopped, cut off in the middle of a bar.
He stepped to one side, away from the door. Coming
towards it were Lucia Lemesurier and her sister.</p>

<p>Neither at once saw Anthony. Then, with a
gracious smile to officialdom, Lucia turned and looked
full at him. He raised his hat and looked grim. He
didn’t mean to look grim; he was merely trying to
behave well in a police-station to a lady he loved and had
offended. Lucia flushed and bowed coldly and walked
down the steps. She hadn’t meant to do any of these
things; but the man <em>did</em> look so forbidding.
“Conceited idiot!” she said to herself, referring to Anthony
and not meaning it in the least.</p>

<p>“Hell!” said Anthony under his breath, and went
rather white.</p>

<p>Dora Masterson held out her hand. “Good-morning,”
she said, and looked curiously at him.</p>

<p>From somewhere he dragged out a smile.</p>

<p>“Morning. Feeling better?”</p>

<p>She beamed at him. “Oh, ever so much! Archie
seems so—so exactly as if everything was the same
as usual. He’s wonderful! And I haven’t forgotten
what you said about miracles. You will do one, won’t
you?” With another smile she ran down the steps
and after her sister. She had scented an intriguing
mystery in the behaviour of these two.</p>

<p>Anthony emerged from thought to find the inspector
looking at him with barely veiled curiosity. He
essayed a cheerful manner. Perhaps the inspector
would be so good as to let him see Mr. Deacon. If
the inspector remembered, Superintendent Boyd——</p>

<p>In less than two minutes he was alone with the
prisoner.</p>

<p>Deacon put down the book he was reading.</p>

<p>“Hallo-allo! More visitors for the condemned
man. Good job you’re early. I believe they’re
moving me to the county clink about eleven.”</p>

<p>Anthony sat down upon the bed. “How are you?”
he said. He said it to gain time. His thoughts, once
so carefully ordered, had been thrown into much
confusion. That bow had been so extremely distant.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” Deacon said slowly and
heavily, “I feel absolutely rotten! It’s beginning to
get on my nerves—all this!” He made a sweeping
gesture. “It—I feel——” He broke off and
laughed. “Fan-tods won’t do any good, will they?
And it’s only what I might have expected. Nurse
always told me my middle name was Crippen.”</p>

<p>Admiration and sympathy cleared Anthony’s head.
“When’s the magistrate’s court?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“The balloon, I believe, goes up at 10 <b>a. m.</b> the day
after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Anthony muttered: “Day after to-morrow, eh?
Well, it may,” and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Deacon half rose, then sat down again. “After
you left me last night,” he said, after a pause, “I had
a visit from Crabbe—the solicitor Digby-Coates got.
We had a long talk, and he’s going to prime Marshall,
who’s going to come and see me to-morrow himself.
So all the legal business is fixed up.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Anthony. “What I came for this
morning was to ask you two questions. Are you
ready?”</p>

<p>“Aye ready!”</p>

<p>“Have you any money? Beside the salary you
got from Hoode, I mean.”</p>

<p>“About two hundred and fifty a year,” said
Deacon. “When Cousin James dies of port it’ll be
about three thousand.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. You made that point with the
solicitor, I hope. It tends to destroy that insane theft
theory.”</p>

<p>“I told the bloke all right. But it won’t count
much, I’m afraid. You see, I’ve been awfully broke
for quite a time now. One thing and another, you
know. However!” He shrugged.</p>

<p>Anthony said: “Now the second question. And
it’s really important! Think carefully before you
answer. When recently—say within the last
week—have you had in your hands <em>any</em> implement of
any kind with a wooden handle four inches long
and about three and a half round? Think, man,
think!”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Ten minutes later, Anthony was running up the
High Street towards his inn. Arrived there, he found
a telegram. It read: “Authentic astounding
revelations by Pellet what next Hastings.”</p>

<p>Anthony wrote on a telegraph form: “Wait
with you afternoon office keep Pellet Gethryn.”
The form he gave to the barman with a ten-shilling
note and instructions for immediate despatch, and
then set off for Abbotshall at a fast walk.</p>

<p>As he entered the gates, a car—an unfamiliar green
Daimler, a woman seated primly beside the chauffeur—left
them. In spite of the heat it was closed.
Peering, Anthony saw the only occupant of the tonneau
to be a woman. She was veiled. He deduced the
flirtatious Mrs. Mainwaring and her Gallic maid.
The sight appeared to amuse him. He walked on
to the house humming beneath his breath.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, he was told by a rejuvenated Belford,
was believed to be in his own sitting-room.</p>

<p>Anthony mounted the stairs. He found Sir Arthur’s
door ajar; on it was pinned a notice in red ink:
“Please do not disturb.” From where he stood, all
Anthony could see was the big armchair drawn up to
the window, the top of an immaculate head above its
back and some six inches of trouser and a boot-sole
by each of its front legs.</p>

<p>Anthony chuckled, knocked, and entered. Sir
Arthur rose, turning a frowning face towards the
intruder. As he saw who it was, a smile replaced the
frown.</p>

<p>“You looked,” said Anthony, “like some weird
animal, sitting like that. Hope I haven’t disturbed
you.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, my boy, not a bit. Very glad to see
you.” He picked up some sheets of paper from the
chair. “As a matter of fact, I was just jotting down
a few notes. I’d like you to read them—not now, but
when they’re finished.” He hesitated; then added
rather shyly: “They’re just some ideas I’ve had
about this awful business. Somehow, I can put them
more clearly in writing. I want to give them to
Marshall before the boy’s tried, but I’d like you to see
them first. There might possibly be some points
which have escaped you, though I expect not.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to look at ’em very much,” Anthony said.
“Get them done as quick as you can, won’t you?
Now, what I interrupted you for: is there in the house
a good collection of reference books?”</p>

<p>“There is. Right-hand book-case in the study.
You’ll find anything you want from sawdust to
Seringapatam. John got together the most
comprehensive reference library <em>I’ve</em> ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Anthony turned to the door. “No,
don’t trouble to come, I’ll find ’em!”</p>

<p>It was, as Sir Arthur had said, a most comprehensive
collection. Anthony locked the study door and
sat at the big writing-table, now back in its old place,
surrounded by the volumes of his choice. They were
many and varied.</p>

<p>He worked for an hour, occasionally scribbling
notes on a slip of paper. At last he rose, stretched
himself, and returned the books to their shelves.
Again sitting at the table, he studied his notes. They
appeared to afford him satisfaction. He folded the
paper and took out his note-case. As he opened it, the
bunch of newspaper-cuttings fluttered down to rest
upon the table.</p>

<p>He picked them up and slid them, with the notes he
had scribbled, back into the case. As he did so a line
of the topmost cutting caught his eye. It was the
quotation from the <i>Æneid</i> which Masterson had
referred to and which then had titillated some elusive
memory. Now where, recently, had he seen this
unusual and meticulous dative case?</p>

<p>His mind wrestled with forgetfulness; then,
suddenly tired, refused to work longer on so arduous a
task. As minds will, it switched abruptly off to the
matter with which it most wished to be occupied.
Before Anthony’s eyes came a picture of a dark, proud
face whose beauty was enhanced by its pallor. He
thought of her as he had seen her that morning; as
he had seen her that first time; as she had sat in her
drawing-room that night—the night he had made her
tell him all about it.</p>

<p>His mind, remorseful, perhaps, made a half-hearted
attempt to get back to that tiresome business of the
correct quotation from Virgil. Suddenly, it connected
the work and the woman. The great light of
recaptured memory burst upon him.</p>

<p>He jumped for the telephone; asked for Greyne
23; was put through at once; thought: “Wonder
who’ll answer?” then heard the “Hallo” of a servant.</p>

<p>“Miss Masterson in?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. What name shall I say?”</p>

<p>He told her. Waiting, he grew excited. If by any
chance he was right, here was yet more confirmation
of his theory.</p>

<p>Dora Masterson’s voice came to his ears. “Hallo.
Is that Mr. Gethryn? I——”</p>

<p>Anthony interrupted. “Yes. I wonder whether
you can help me. The second time I was in your
house I picked up a book. Little green book. Soft
leather binding. Essays. Pleasantly written. One
was called ‘Love at First Sight.’ Author’s name on
title-page was a woman’s. D’you know the book I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Is it one called <i>Here and There</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, now who wrote it? Was it really a woman?
And is that her real name? I meant to ask at the
time, but forgot.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>At twenty minutes to two that afternoon, Anthony
stopped his car outside <i>The Owl’s</i> office. He had
broken no record this time; his mind had been much
occupied on the journey. The interviews he had held
with Belford, Mabel Smith, and Elsie Syme before
leaving Abbotshall had given him food for thought.</p>

<p>He found Hastings in his room, with him a little,
dapper, sly-eyed Jew. “Discreet Inquiries. Divorces,
Watching, etc.,” thought Anthony.</p>

<p>“This,” murmured Hastings, “is Mr. Pellett.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes.” Anthony sat down heavily. He was
tired and very hungry. He had not eaten since
breakfast. Mr. Pellett displeased him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pellett,” said Hastings, “has some information
which should interest you. I have paid him fifty
pounds. He wants another two hundred.”</p>

<p>“He would,” Anthony said. “And if he’s got what
I want he shall have it.”</p>

<p>“Thath right,” said Mr. Pellett with a golden smile.</p>

<p>“It may be.” Anthony fixed him with a glittering
eye. “Let us hear you, Mr.—er—Pellet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pellett cleared his throat, produced a packet of
papers, wiped his hands on a pink silk handkerchief and
began.</p>

<p>“About theeth three newthpaperth,” he said—and
went on for one hour and fifty-seven minutes by the
clock on Hastings’s table.</p>

<p>He got his two hundred pounds.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>There was a matinée at the Regency. At half-past
four, Anthony was at the stage-door.</p>

<p>The stage-door keeper remembered that five-pound
note and the foreign gent. He was civil. Yes,
Madarm Vander was in the theatre. She had, indeed, just
finished her performance. He would see if the—the
prince could be admitted. The prince scribbled on a
card, placed the card in an envelope, and sealed the
envelope. As balm for tender feelings, he gave the
door-keeper a flashing foreign smile and a pound-note.</p>

<p>He was kept waiting not more than three minutes.
After four, he was ushered into the most sacred
dressing-room in Europe.</p>

<p>From a silken couch in a silken corner a silken,
scented vision rose to meet him.</p>

<p>Anthony saw that they were alone. He bowed,
kissing the imperious hand. He was regarded with
approval by tawny, Slavonic eyes.</p>

<p>She peered at the card in her hand. “Who air you,”
she said “that write to me of—of John?”</p>

<p>Anthony proceeded to make himself clear.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o’clock when he left the theatre.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>By half-past six Anthony was in his flat. At seven
he bathed; at eight dined. From eight-thirty to nine
he smoked—and thought. From nine until midnight
he wrote, continuing his work of the night before.
Save for occasional reference to notes, he wrote for
those three hours without a pause. From midnight
until one he considered what he had written. Then,
after a long and powerful drink, he unearthed from its
lair his typewriter.</p>

<p>It was lucky, he reflected, that two years ago he
had wearied at last of professional typists and taken a
machine unto himself.</p>

<p>From one-thirty in the morning until five—three
whole hours and a half—he typed. There were two
reasons why the work took him so long: the first, that
he had not used the machine for six months; the second,
that in copying what he had written he was constantly
polishing, correcting, altering, improving.</p>

<p>At five he discarded the typewriter, took pen and
paper and wrote a letter. This, together with the
typewritten document, he placed in a large envelope.
He stamped the envelope; was about to leave the flat
and post it; then changed his mind. It should be sent
by special messenger as early as one could be found
awake.</p>

<p>He did not go to bed, feeling that if he did, nothing
could wake him for at least twelve hours. He had
another drink, another bath, and, when he had roused
his man, a breakfast.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch16">

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br/> Revelation and the Sparrow</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>His meal over, he left the flat, going first to a
District Messengers’ office and then back to the
garage for his car.</p>

<p>He knew the road to Marling so well by this time
that he could almost have driven blindfold, and he
has said that on this morning he once or twice found
himself to have been sleeping at the wheel. It is
certain, anyhow, that he barely saw where he was
going. Such thought as his tired brain could compass
was not of murders and murderers, but of Love, a
Lover and a Lady.</p>

<p>It was, if one is to believe him, at the cross-roads
beyond Beachmere that he made up his mind to see
Her, to drive straight to the house on the bank of the
Marle.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. The hands pointed to ten.
He settled down in his seat. The needle on the
speedometer jerked to twenty, to twenty-five; then
gradually crept on till it hesitated between forty-five and
fifty.</p>

<p>His spirits mounted with the speed. The car tore
her way into Marling and down the cobbled slope of
the High Street, swung to the left, took the little bridge
at a bound, raced on, turned the corner next on the
left after the river bank on two wheels, ploughed up
the little lane, and pulled up at the gates of the house
which was graced with Her presence.</p>

<p>Or should have been. For the parlourmaid
informed him that her mistress and her mistress’s sister
were out. For the day, she thought. She was not
sure, but she imagined the ladies to have gone to
London.</p>

<p>Anthony, his fatigue heavy upon him, walked slowly
back to his car. For a moment he sat idle in
the driving-seat; then suddenly quickened into life.
Though their ultimate destination might indeed be
London, the women would surely stop on their way
through Greyne. For in Greyne’s jail was Deacon.</p>

<p>So to Greyne he drove at speed. He missed them
by five minutes.</p>

<p>Had Anthony Gethryn been a man of common
sense he would have returned at once to his Marling
inn, fallen upon his bed, and let Sleep have her way
with him. But he was not, so he stayed with Deacon.
Deacon was obviously—in spite of his flippancy—delighted
at this visit. Anthony stayed with him until
two o’clock, when the great Sir Edward Marshall,
K.C., arrived in person for consultation with his latest
case, and then set out for Marling. This he did not
reach for two hours, fatigue and preoccupation having
cost him no fewer than three wrong turnings.</p>

<p>At the inn was waiting the reply to the letter
he had sent by District Messenger that morning. It
had come, this reply, in the form of a seemingly
ordinary message over the inn’s telephone. It was
what he had expected, but nevertheless it made it
necessary for him to think.</p>

<p>And think he did, sitting on the hot grass bank at
the edge of the little bowling-green behind the inn,
for as long as it takes to smoke one cigar and two
pipes. Then he sought the bar, to slake a savage
thirst.</p>

<p>He ordered a meal to be served at seven. To pass
the hour that must elapse before this and to throw
off the lassitude brought on by his fatigue and the
oppression of the day’s heavy, airless heat, he sought
the bathroom and much cold water.</p>

<p>After the bath he felt better. He returned to his
quarters whistling. Crossing his sitting-room to get
to the bedroom which opened out of it, he saw
something he had not noticed when going bath-wards.
The whistling ceased abruptly. On the table in the
centre of the room lay an envelope. His name was
on it, in hurried, pencilled scrawl. The writing was
feminine.</p>

<p>He ripped it open, read, and jumped for the door.
The pink-cheeked chambermaid came running. She
would not have believed this quiet gentleman could
shout so loud, nor so angrily.</p>

<p>Anthony, his lank black hair dishevelled, his long,
lean body swathed in a bath-gown, towered
wrathfully above her.</p>

<p>“When did this note arrive?” He waved the
envelope in her face.</p>

<p>The girl fingered her apron. “Oh, sir! It came
this morning, please, sir. Lady left it, sir. Just
after ten, it was. Mrs. Lermeesherer, sir.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know!” Anthony snorted. “But why
in Satan’s name wasn’t I told about it when I got back
this evening?” He went back into his room, slamming
the door and feeling not a little ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>The little chambermaid clattered downstairs to
discuss with her colleagues the strange effect of a note
upon a gentleman before so pleasant.</p>

<p>Anthony clad himself with speed; then ran downstairs
to the telephone. The answer to his first call
was disappointing. No, Mrs. Lemesurier was not
back; would not be, probably, until eight.</p>

<p>He rang off, swore, bethought him of his work,
made sure that the door of the telephone cabinet was
closed, lifted the receiver and asked for another
number.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes before he left the cabinet and
went slowly to his dinner. He ate little, fatigue,
preoccupation, and the stifling heat of the evening
combining to deprive him of appetite. Over coffee
he re-read his letter. It is a tribute to his
self-restraint that he had delayed so long. It was a
short letter, running thus:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter"><div>

<p>“<span class="salutation">Dear Mr. Gethryn,</span>—I am sorry you were out: I
wanted to apologise for my unpardonable behavior. I
can’t think what made me so foolish; and quite see now
that you had to talk to Jim and also that he was none the
worse for the interview—in fact I hear from Mr. Hastings,
who rang up early this morning, that he is ever so
much better!</p>

<p>“If you are not too busy and would care to, do come
and see us this evening. I would ask you to dinner, but
we shall probably be late and have a very scrappy meal.</p>

<p class="valediction">“Yours gratefully,</p>
<p class="signature">“Lucia Lemesurier.”</p>

<p>“P.S.—You were rather hard on me, weren’t you?
You see, I had asked Dot and she had urged me to go to
town!”</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>There is a peculiar and subtle and quite indefinable
pleasure that comes to a man when the woman he
loves first writes to him. Soever curt, soever banal
the letter, there is no matter. It is something from
Her to him; something altogether private and secret;
something She has set down for him to read;
something not to be shared with a sordid world.</p>

<p>Anthony lost himself in this sea of subtle delight,
varying joy with outbursts against himself for
having exhibited such boorishness and for being so
insanely, so youthfully in love. “For, after all,”
he told himself, “I haven’t known her for a week
yet. I’ve spoken with her not a dozen times. I am
clearly a fool!”</p>

<p>Unpleasant thoughts broke in upon him. He
looked at his watch; then jumped to his feet and
made his way upstairs to his rooms. He reached
them mopping his forehead. He could not remember
a day in England so oppressive.</p>

<p>He took his hat and turned to leave the room.
As he did so a rush of wind swept in through the
open window, and a long, low angry mutter of
thunder came to his ears. Then, with a rush,
came the rain; great sheets of it, glistening in the
half-dusk.</p>

<p>Anthony put on a mackintosh, substituted a cap
for the hat, and left the inn. He did not take his
car. Even as he turned out of the yard into the
cobbled street, the thunder changed from rumble to
sharp, staccato reports, and three jagged swords of
lightning tore the black of the sky.</p>

<p>Anthony strode on, hands thrust deep into pockets,
chin burrowed into the upturned collar of the
trench-coat. Incredibly almost, the volume of rain increased
and increased.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Mr. Poole the butler—Anthony once said that he
sounded like a game of Happy Families—was in a
state of nervous agitation verging upon breakdown.
The events of the past few days had shaken him,
for some time an old man aged beyond his years,
to such extent that he would not, he was sure,
“ever be the same man again.”</p>

<p>He sat in the little room opposite that which had
been the master’s study. He shivered with age,
vague fears, and fervent distaste for the storm whose
rain beat upon the windows, whose sudden furies of
wind shook the old house, whose flashes of lightning
played such havoc with the nerves.</p>

<p>Mr. Poole was alone. Miss Hoode had retired.
Sir Arthur was reading in the billiard-room at the
other end of the house. Belford was on three days’
holiday, his wife, it seemed, being an invalid.
The other servants were certainly either in bed or
huddled together moaning as women will at the
violence of the storm.</p>

<p>Mr. Poole was alone. All manner of lurking
terrors preyed upon him. There were noises. Sounds
which seemed like the master’s voice. Sounds which
seemed like the rustling of curtains, whispering and
soft footsteps. Elusive sounds as of doors opening
and shutting. Mr. Poole trembled. He knew, his
fears groundless; imaginings born of the roaring
rattle of the Universe. But nevertheless he trembled.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a knocking on the great front
door. This knocking was not loud, yet it seemed
to the old man the more terrible for that. For there
is always something terrible about a knock upon a
door.</p>

<p>For a full minute he strove to leave the shelter
of the little, cheerful, glowing room. At last he
succeeded, struggling through the beastly mysteries of the
dimly lighted hall to open with trembling hands the
great oak door.</p>

<p>Anthony stepped over the threshold; stripped off
dripping cap and mackintosh.</p>

<p>“A dirty night, Poole,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is indeed, sir! Indeed it is, sir!” The old
man’s voice was hysterical with relief.</p>

<p>Across the hall to them came Sir Arthur, sturdy,
benign, hair as smoothly brushed as ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it, Gethryn?” he said. “I wondered
who was knocking. You must have very pressing
business to bring you up here on a night like this.
Aren’t you wet?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of. I wanted to talk with you.
It’s important—and urgent.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur grew eager. “My dear boy, of course.
Where shall we go? Billiard-room?”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>They turned, but before they had crossed the hall,</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” Anthony said, “the study’d be
better. Not so near the servants, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Sir Arthur agreed.</p>

<p>The study had that queer stillness which comes to
a room at one time in constant use and then suddenly
deserted save for the morning activities of a servant
with duster and broom. It had an air of almost
supernatural lifelessness, increased, perhaps, by the fact
that now everything was in its accustomed place; the
same pictures on the walls; the table; the chairs; the
very curtains cutting off the alcove at the far end
of the room hanging in the old slightly disordered
folds.</p>

<p>A silence fell upon both men while they found chairs
and drew them up to the table, under the light.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur spoke first. “Out with it, now, Gethryn.
You’ve excited me, you know.” He rubbed his hands.
“I’ve always thought you’d do something; go one
better than those damn’ fools of policemen!”</p>

<p>Anthony leant back in his chair. “This,” he said,
“is a most unusual business. I said so at the
beginning, and, by God, I say so now! You might say
that I have solved the mystery. After I’ve told you,
that is. And in another way, as you’ll see, it’s more
of a puzzle than ever.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur leant forward. “Go on, man, go on!
Do you mean to say you actually know who killed
John?”</p>

<p>“I do not.” Anthony laid his head against the
back of his chair and closed his leaden, burning
eyes.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur started to his feet. A crash of thunder
drowned his words. Followed a zig-zag of lightning
so vivid as to seem more a stage-effect than an outburst
of nature. Outside, the rain fell heavily, solidly—a
veil of water. The furious blast of wind which had
come hard on the heels of the great peal died away
in a plaintive moan.</p>

<p>Anthony opened his eyes. “What did you say?
Before that barrage, I mean.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur paced the room. “What did I say?”
he exploded. “I said that if you hadn’t found out
who did it, I couldn’t see the use of coming here and
gabbling about mystery. Damn it, man, we’re not in
a two-shilling novel! We’ve got to get Deacon off,
that’s what we’ve got to do! <em>And</em> find the murderer!
Not sit here and play at Holmes and Watson. It’s
<em>silly</em>, what we’re doing! And I expected great things
of you, Gethryn!”</p>

<p>“That,” Anthony said placidly, “was surely foolish.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur made impatient sounds in his throat;
but lessened the pace of his prowling. Under the
graying hair his broad forehead was creased in a
tremendous frown.</p>

<p>Anthony lit a cigarette. “But I may yet interest
you,” he went on. “You said, I think, that you
wished to lay your hands on the murderer.”</p>

<p>“I did. And by God I meant it!”</p>

<p>Anthony looked up at him. “Suppose you sit down
and then I’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>“Sit down!” Sir Arthur shouted. “Sit down!
God above, you’ll be telling me to keep calm next!”
He flung himself into his chair. “Here I am then.
Now get on!” He buried his face in his hands;
then looked up to say: “You must forgive me,
Gethryn; I’m not myself. I’ve been more on edge
the last few days—a lot more—than I’ve let any one
see. And to-night, somehow, my nerves have gone.
And when you came with news I thought it meant
that you’d caught the real murderer and that the boy
would get off—and—and everything!”</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you,” Anthony said, “that
the murderer of John Hoode will never be caught.
To get him is impossible. Please understand that
when I say impossible I mean it.”</p>

<p>“But why, man? Why?” cried Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>“Because,” said Anthony slowly, “he doesn’t exist.”</p>

<p>“What?” Sir Arthur was on his feet again at
a bound astonishing in its agility.</p>

<p>Anthony lay back in his chair. “I can’t bear it!
I can’t bear it!” he said plaintively. “You know,
you’re very violent to-night. I can’t talk if you will
jump about so.”</p>

<p>The elder man groaned apology and sat again in
his chair. His eyes, bewildered, sought Anthony’s.</p>

<p>Raising his voice to carry above the increasing
roar of the storm, Anthony said: “Sorry if I seem
too mysterious. But you must let me elucidate
in my own way. Here goes: I have said that the
murderer of John Hoode doesn’t exist. I don’t
mean that the murderer’s dead or that Hoode
committed suicide. I mean that John Hoode was
never killed; is not, in fact, dead.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur’s lips moved, but no sound came from
them. His chair was outside the circle of light
and it was by the vivid violet illumination of a
quivering glare of lightning that Anthony saw the
pallor the shock of his revelation had caused.
Following that lightning came peal after peal of
thunder.</p>

<p>As it died away, Anthony saw that the other was
speaking. He had not moved in his chair, but his
strong, square hands were twisting about each other
to testify to the intensity of his emotion.</p>

<p>“What are you telling me?” he whispered. “Are
you mad? John not dead! John not dead! Why,
it’s idiocy—stark idiocy to say what you have said!”</p>

<p>Anthony shook his head. “It isn’t. Whatever
it is, it isn’t that. Wait till I have told you more.
It’s a long tale and strange.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur moistened his lips with his tongue but
did not speak. Anthony’s words had carried
conviction; his words and a way he had of commanding
attention.</p>

<p>The thunder, after the outburst of a moment before,
seemed to have ceased entirely. No sudden furies
of wind shook the house. The only sounds in the
oppressive room were the tick-tick of the grandfather
clock and the soft hish-hish of the rain against the
closed windows.</p>

<p>Anthony drew a deep breath, and began:—</p>

<p>“My first impression of this affair was, as you know,
that it was a straightforward murder, committed by
some member of this household. Later, I had good
reason to search this table here, and it was from the
time of that search that I began to revise my theories.
In this table I found—as I had expected—a drawer
hidden from the casual eye. From that drawer I took
some letters, a collection of newspaper-cuttings, a
memorandum book, and other papers. You shall see
them all in due course.</p>

<p>“The letters gave me my first inkling that there
was something more obscure about the case than I
had thought. So I went to the lady who had
written those letters. From her I got the first pieces
of the story, not without difficulty. I also went to
see a man who had once been Hoode’s secretary.
He was obliging and clever. He had seen things,
heard things, while he served Hoode, that had
set him thinking. He thought so much that he
employed, on his own initiative, a private detective.
I have seen the detective. The detective, even after
he was told to drop the business, went on detecting.
You see, he had become interested. He is not a nice
man. He smelt scandal and money. He, without
knowing it, has helped me to piece together the whole
amazing story—the story which shows how it was that
John Hoode was not killed.” Anthony paused, taking
a last puff at his cigarette.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, gray of face, hammered with his fists
on the leather-padded arms of his chair.</p>

<p>“But the body!” he gasped. “The body! It was
there!” He glanced wildly over his shoulder at the
fireplace. “I saw it! I tell you I saw it!” His
voice gathered strength. “And the inquest, the arrests,
the identifications! And the funeral! Why, you
fool!” he cried in a great voice, “the funeral is
to-morrow. All England will be there! And you tell
me this absurd story. What in God’s name has
come to you that you can play pranks of this sort?
Haven’t we all suffered enough without this?” The
man was shaking.</p>

<p>Anthony sat up. “Wait!” he said. “And let me
finish. I said that John Hoode had not been murdered.
I did not say that no murder had been done. Murder
was done. I know it. You know it. The world
knows it. But what you and the world do not know
is that the body upon which the inquest was held, the
body which is to be buried to-morrow, is not the body
of John Hoode!”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur glared at him. “What does this
mean?” he said, and his lips trembled. “What is all
this? I don’t understand! I—I——”</p>

<p>Sleep was creeping insidiously upon Anthony. He
wished that the storm had not ceased. Its
violence had at least helped to keep one awake, helped
to conquer this deadly fatigue which made talking
so great an effort.</p>

<p>He began again: “The story is this. And though
it’s as mad as Hatta and the King’s Messenger,
it’s true. John Hoode’s mother, as you probably
know, was, before marriage, a Miss Monteith.
His father, as you must know also, was John Howard
Beauleigh Hoode. Now, do you know that your
John Hoode is very like—to look at, I mean—one of
his parents and not the other?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. He and his father were—well like
twin brothers almost.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. John Howard Beauleigh Hoode had a
way of passing on his features. John Howard
Beauleigh Hoode was married to Miss Adeline Rose
Monteith in ’73. In ’72 John Howard Beauleigh
Hoode’s mistress, the daughter of Ian Dougal—he
was a smith in Ardenross—gave birth to a son.
That son, named also John, was maintained and
educated at his father’s expense; but he turned out as
complete a waster as any man well could be. John
Hoode—your John—didn’t know of his half-brother’s
existence until John Howard Beauleigh Hoode’s
death. When he did find out—from his father’s
executors, I imagine—John—your John—was good
to his bastard brother; and when first he saw him, he
marvelled exceedingly at this bastard brother’s likeness
to him, for to look at his face was almost like looking
into a mirror.</p>

<p>“The result of his kindness was the expected.
Ingratitude, surliness, constant demands for money
and yet more money; finally threats and
blackmail——”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” groaned Sir Arthur, his face in
his hands. “It’s all lies, lies! I knew John. He
told me everything, everything!”</p>

<p>“Not he,” Anthony said. “I’ve all the papers.
Some of them here.” He tapped his breast-pocket.
“Birth certificates. Copy of John Howard Beauleigh
Hoode’s will, and so on. It’s all by the book.
Well, things went from bad to worse and from worse
to intolerable for John—your John. These threats—I’ll
show you some letters later—wore his nerves,
his health, to shreds. He tried every way of
kindness—and failed.” Anthony paused to moisten with
his tongue his parched lips.</p>

<p>“Finally,” he went on, “John—your John—found
his work for the State to be suffering. He is, as
I see him, an upright, conscientious, kindly man,
but determined. He made up his mind. He would
help once more, but once more only. He sent for
the other John. He told him when and how to
come, how to approach the house, to get into this
room by that window, all without being seen.</p>

<p>“The other John came at the appointed time
and knocked on the window. Your John helped him
in. The other John, as always, was rotten with
liquor. Your John told of the determination he had
come to that this was to be the last time if the other
John did not amend his ways. Then came trouble.
Perhaps half-brother was more drunk than usual.
Anyhow, he attacked your John. Sodden with drink
though he was, he was the more powerful man.
But John—your John—managed somehow to tear
himself free. Not knowing what he did; he picked
up the heavy poker and struck, not once, but many
times——”</p>

<p>“But what—— Good God——!”</p>

<p>Anthony overrode the interruption. “Wait. Don’t
speak till I’ve finished. Appalled at what he had done,
he stood looking down at his bastard half-brother’s
body. It sprawled there on the hearth in its untidy,
shabby, mud-stained clothes. It was not, I conceive,
a pretty sight. Then John—your John—did what
better men had done before him. He lost his head.
Completely he lost his head. And he thought at the
time that he was clever!</p>

<p>“He locked the door, quietly, as the struggle had
been quiet. Better for him had the struggle been
noisy! He stripped to the skin. Then, naked as he
was born, he stripped that sprawling thing which had
been his brother. He donned the foul linen and
musty clothes, the worn-out boots. More horrid still,
he clad the body in his own good clothing. Carefully
he did it, even to the tying of the black bow. And all
the time, beneath his horror, was wonder for the
amazing likeness of the thing’s face and body to his
own. For half-brother John was not one of those
who carry the stamp of their dissipations.</p>

<p>“Then John—your John—hurried away. Through
that window he went. As he crouched outside it, he
heard the door of the room, which he had unlocked,
open. He peered, and saw his sister. He saw her
hand fly to her bosom. He saw her rush to the thing
on the hearth. And he knew that his sister took that
Thing for the brother she had known and loved and
cherished all her life.</p>

<p>“He heard her scream. He saw her sway and
fall. For an instant sanity returned, and he thought
of going back to help her. Then fear got him by
the throat again; fear of arrest; fear of publicity;
fear of the hangman. He saw it all. And he drifted
silently away through the darkness. And next
morning, while the world read about his death, John Hoode
lay in a Whitechapel doss-house. Later, an officious
policeman found a carpenter’s wood-rasp and on it
some blood and some finger-prints. So Deacon was
arrested for the murder of a man who was still alive.
The blood on that wood-rasp was not the dead man’s,
nor were the finger-prints Deacon’s. The explanation
is long, but I will give it if you like.” Anthony half
closed his eyes and lay back in his chair.</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the room.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur shattered it. He leapt to his feet, his
virility returned uncannily, a thousandfold. The
light-blue eyes held fire in them.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” he roared. “It’s a lie!” He smashed
his fist down upon the table. “A lie, I tell you!
What’s that?” He turned sharply to face the end of
the room.</p>

<p>“What?” Anthony rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing.” He came close to Anthony.
“What you tell me is lies! All lies! Lies and more
lies, you——” His voice rose with each word.</p>

<p>Suddenly, amazingly, Anthony shouted too. “It’s
true, and you must believe it! Your help is wanted.”
He thrust his thin, dark face at the other’s. “It’s
the truth! Truth! D’you understand? I know!
I know because, because <em>Hoode told me himself—to-day!
He’s coming here to-night! Now!</em>”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur flung his arms above his head. “Lies,
lies, lies!” His voice rose to a harsh, unnatural
scream. “All lies! God rot him! Christ torture
his soul in hell! He’s dead! He’s dead! You fool!
<em>I</em> know, <em>I</em>, <em>I!</em> You know nothing!” His hands
seemed to be reaching higher, clawing, as if they would
tear holes in heaven. “You fool!” he screamed again.
“He’s dead. <em>I</em> know! <em>I killed him!</em> I climbed down
and killed him——”</p>

<p>Anthony sat down on the edge of the table. “That’ll
be all, I think,” he said.</p>

<p>The curtains over the alcove at the end of the room
parted. From behind them came three men: the first
tall and of middle-aged immaculateness, the second an
obvious detective-inspector, the third negligible save
for the pencil and notebook he carried.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur turned, crouching like an animal, to see
the invasion. In a flash he whipped round and leapt
at Anthony’s throat, his arms outflung, his fingers
crooked. Anthony, still sitting, had little time to avoid
the rush. He raised a knee sharply. Sir Arthur fell
to the floor, where for a time he rolled in agony.</p>

<p>The obvious detective-inspector bent over him.
There was a click of handcuffs.</p>

<p>The immaculate man advanced to the table. “Very
good indeed, Gethryn,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Anthony said. “I suppose you’re
satisfied now, Lucas?”</p>

<p>“Eminently, Gethryn, eminently!” Mr. Lucas
beamed.</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right.” Anthony’s tone was heavy.
“Now what about young Deacon? Can you unwind
the red tape quickly?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas leant forward. “If you like,” he whispered,
“I can arrange for him to get away to-night.
It’s all very wrong and most unofficial; but I can
manage it. Speak to the chief on the phone and all
that sort of thing, you know.”</p>

<p>Anthony’s face relaxed into a smile. “Good for
you. You might have Deacon told that if he likes I
can arrange for the Bear and Key to fix him up for
to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him myself,” said the other. “You’re
really rather a wonder, Gethryn! We ought to have
you as a sort of super-superintendent. Or you might
do well on the stage. At one time just now you
almost took me in with that grisly tale and manner of
yours. And what a yarn it was, too. Just enough
to make that half-crazy devil think he’d killed the
wrong man. Enough, I mean, to make him wonder
whether you hadn’t got half the tale right and had
only gone astray about who actually did the bashing.”
Lucas chuckled reminiscently. “I say,” he added,
“it was a good thing nobody heard us getting in here
through the window. It would’ve spoilt the whole
thing. The storm effect helped everything along nicely,
though, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It did,” Anthony said. “I didn’t arrange that, you
know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas smiled. “No, I suppose not; though
I’m so full at the moment of wonder and admiration
for the great Colonel Gethryn that if any one told
me you had, I don’t know that I should disbelieve
’em.” He turned to look at the prisoner. “God!”
he exclaimed. “Look at that!”</p>

<p>For Sir Arthur was sitting quietly at the feet of
the plain-clothes man. And he was playing a little
game with his manacled hands, tracing with both
forefingers the intricate pattern of the carpet. Every now
and again he would look up at his guard and laugh. It
was not a pleasant sound, being childish and yet
somehow evil.</p>

<p>Anthony looked, then turned away with a shiver.
Lucas dropped a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Gethryn,” he said, after a moment.
“It isn’t your fault.”</p>

<p>Anthony shook off the hand. “Damn it, I know
that! Only the whole thing is so filthy. It might be
said, I know, that I sent That mad. But it wouldn’t
be true. He did that himself. Hatred, ingrowing
hatred of a better man: that’s the cause.”</p>

<p>Lucas was thoughtful. “It complicates things, this
madness.”</p>

<p>“It does. What’ll happen?”</p>

<p>“Usual, I suppose. The case’ll be tried. He’ll be
convicted—and sent to Broadmoor, where he’ll die, or
recover in a year and be let out to kill some one else.
We’re so humane, you know!” Lucas was bitter.
“Anyhow, you won’t be bothered any more, except
for the trial, at which you’ll figure prominently. Oh,
yes! Great glory will be yours, Gethryn. Think what
a press you’ll have!”</p>

<p>Anthony grunted his disgust.</p>

<p>Lucas went on: “Lord! <em>What</em> a stir this is going
to make. Millionaire M.P. arrested for murder of
Cabinet Minister! It won’t be nice for us at the
Yard either. Not at all nice! Getting hold of an
innocent man and all that. Police shown the way by
amateur!” He groaned. “Never mind, <i>The Owl</i>
shall be the first to publish anything. I arranged that
before I came down. And then they’ll have that report
of yours to get out, too. What envy will tear Fleet
street! Of course, that report can’t come out yet,
you know. At least, I don’t think so; not before the
trial——”</p>

<p>Anthony started. “Lucas,” he said, “there’s
something we’ve forgotten.” He put a hand up to his
hair.</p>

<p>“Gad! So we have. Let’s see.”</p>

<p>Together they stooped over the prisoner. He looked
up at them and cackled.</p>

<p>“Rotten business!” Anthony grunted. “Seems
almost indecent when the man’s like this.” He put his
hand on Sir Arthur’s head. His fingers groped for
a moment; then came away. With them came that
immaculate head of graying hair.</p>

<p>“Wonderful <i lang="fr">toupé</i>!” Lucas stretched out his hands
for it. “I’d never have noticed it. And I thought
they were always obvious. Well, that’s the last
confirmation of your theory, Gethryn.” He peered at
Anthony. “Lord! You look worn out, man!”</p>

<p>Anthony said heavily: “I am. Think I’ll get back
to bed at my pub.”</p>

<p>Lucas glanced at his watch. “Yes, do. Get off
now: it’s only ten past eleven. Shall——”</p>

<p>“What time did you say it was?”</p>

<p>“Eleven-ten.”</p>

<p>“Gad! I thought I’d been here at least five hours.
Only eleven-ten! And I’m sitting here!” Anthony
made for the door.</p>

<p>Lucas grabbed at his arm. “Here, what’s to do?”</p>

<p>“Got to go and pay a call.” Anthony wrenched
himself free and got to the door, paused to say over
his shoulder: “Don’t tell Deacon to come to my pub.
Just let him go. He’ll get where I want him,” and
was gone.</p>

<p>Lucas stared after him. “Fool ought to be in bed,”
he muttered. “Clever devil, though, but queer!” He
turned to the business on hand.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur still sat on the floor, playing his game.
His fingers wandered ceaselessly over the carpet. His
head, bald save for a sand-coloured tonsure, was sunk
between his square shoulders. Every now and then he
laughed that high-pitched laugh.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br/> By “The Owl’s” Commissioner</h2>

<p>The letter which Anthony had written in the
early hours of that morning and despatched
by District Messenger, the letter which had brought
so important a person as Mr. Egbert Lucas down to
Abbotshall, had run as follows:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter"><div>

<p>“<span class="salutation">My Dear Lucas,</span>—As you know, I have been playing
at detectives down at Marling. I have finished my game;
the rest is up to you.</p>

<p>“What I have found, how I have found it, and my
opinion of the meaning of what I have found you will
discover set out in the enclosed document, typed by my
very own fingers. You may—I cannot tell—think my
conclusions wrong, and say that in real life, even as in
fairy tales, a set of circumstances, a collection of clues,
may equally lead to the innocent as to the guilty. For me,
however, I am convinced. To put it in my own diffident
way: I <em>know</em> that I am right!</p>

<p>“So please read the enclosed. If you agree with me,
as I think you will, you will yet find that the evidence is
insufficient: and you will be right. I will, therefore,
endeavour to arrange for a confession by the guilty person
to be given in the (unsuspected) presence of officers of
your able department. In order for this to be done, will
you give orders for some of your men—three, including
a shorthand writer, would be enough—to meet me at the
cross-roads on the London side of Marling at about nine
to-night? I will then get them covertly into Abbotshall
and dispose them in advantageous but secret positions.
This may, I know, be irregular, but you can take it that
I can manage things without any one in the house knowing
until the business is over. Once your men are where I
shall put them, I shall enter the house by a more orthodox
way. The rest will follow.</p>

<p>“This is asking a lot of you, but, after all, you know
me well enough to be reasonably certain that I am less of
a fool than most. So, if you agree with my conclusions
as set out in the report, please arrange this. Whether
you agree or not, ring me up, before seven to-night, at my
pub in Marling (Greyne 29). If I am not there leave a
message: ‘All right’ or ‘Nothing doing,’ as the case may
be. Whichever your answer is, I will ring you up when
I have received it.</p>

<p>“My main reason—or one of my main reasons—for
doing all this work was to do Hastings’s little paper, <i>The
Owl</i>, a good turn. The report is really for them, though
I don’t know when and to what extent you will allow them
to publish it. But I rely on you to see that <i>The Owl</i> gets
as much journalistic fat as it can digest. No other paper
must hear a whisper until you’ve allowed Hastings to make
a scoop out of the ‘Dramatic New Developments.’</p>

<p class="valediction">“Yours,</p>
<p class="signature">“A. R. Gethryn.”</p>

<p>“P.S.—Don’t forget that if you decide to let me try to
arrange this confession, I may fail. I don’t think I will;
but I might. I shall rely to a great extent upon the fact
that I am something of an actor.”</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>Coming to the end of this letter, Mr. Egbert Lucas
had whistled beneath his breath, instructed his secretary
that on no account was he to be disturbed, and had
settled down—he has the most comfortable chair in
the Yard—to read the typewritten report.</p>

<p>Unfolding it, he murmured: “Unexpected chap,
Gethryn. This ought to be interesting.”</p>

<p>He read:—</p>

<p class="headline">“The Murder Of John Hoode</p>

<p>“Upon the morning of the 20th of August, 192–,
I drove to the village of Marling in Surrey. By 9.30
<b>a. m.</b> I had gained admission to the house Abbotshall.</p>

<p>“Owing to circumstances which need not be set
down here, and also, in a great measure, to the courtesy
and assistance of Superintendent Boyd of Scotland
Yard, I was able from the beginning to pursue
unhampered my own investigations. The result of these
I give below.</p>

<p>“(For reasons which must, I think, be obvious, I
have divided this report into four parts. Also, I
would point out that, for reasons equally evident, the
steps in my deduction, reasoning—call it what you
will—are not necessarily given here in their
chronological order.)</p>

<p class="headline">I</p>

<p>“Immediately upon my arrival at Abbotshall, I
spoke at some length with Superintendent Boyd, who
gave me the history of the affair as obtained by him
through close questioning of the inmates. It appeared
then that with the exception of the butler, these one
and all had alibis, complete in some cases and in others
as nearly so as could be expected of persons who had
not known beforehand that they were like to be
accused of murder. (Later, of course, it was
revealed—see reports of the inquest—that Mr. Archibald
Deacon’s alibi did not exist in fact.)</p>

<p>“Superintendent Boyd and I at once agreed that to
suspect the alibiless Poole (the butler) was folly. He
had been, obviously and by common report, devoted to
his master. Moreover, he is physically incapable—even
were he out of his mind—of dealing such blows as
caused the death of the murdered man.</p>

<p>“After our conversation, Superintendent Boyd and
I together made an examination of the study, the room
in which the murder was done. Together we came to
the following conclusions,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="pginternal">¹</a> all of which were explained
by the superintendent in his evidence at the inquest.
Since, therefore, these points are by this common
knowledge, I will not go into the processes by which
they were arrived at, but will merely enumerate them
as follows:—</p>

<p>“(i) That when Hoode was struck, either by the
    first or all the blows, he was seated at
    his table.</p>

<p>“(ii) That the appearance of the room had been
    carefully arranged to convey the impression
    that a struggle had taken place.</p>

<p>“(iii) That the murderer was well known to
    Hoode, and was, in all probability, an
    inmate of the house.</p>

<p>“(iv) That the murderer had worn gloves for
    most of the time during which he was in
    the study, there being no finger-prints
    anywhere except on the wood-rasp.</p>

<p>“(v) That the blows which killed Hoode must
    have had tremendous strength behind
    them.</p>

<p>“(vi) That, in all probability, the murderer
    entered by the window. (I fully endorsed,
    at that stage of the inquiry, the opinion
    of the Police that Poole’s evidence was
    reliable.)</p>

<p>“It will be seen that the cumulative implication of
these six points tends to strengthen considerably the
case against Deacon, which even without them is by
no means weak circumstantially. It is now, therefore,
that the keynote of my report must come.</p>

<p>“I met and spoke with Deacon for the first time on
the afternoon of the day I arrived at Abbotshall. It
needed but three minutes with him to convince me
that here was a man who had not been, was not,
and never could be a murderer. I cannot defend this
statement with logic. It was simply conviction.
Like this: In a party of, say, twelve persons there will
be eleven about none of whom I could say definitely:
‘That one is incapable of stealing the baby’s
marmalade’; but in the twelfth I may find a man—perhaps
unknown to me before—of whom I can swear before
God or man: ‘He <em>could</em> not have stolen the baby’s
marmalade—not even if he had tried to! He is
incapable of carrying out such a crime.’</p>

<p>“Deacon was a twelfth man. Before I had seen
him, my views were beginning to differ from those
of Scotland Yard: after I had seen and spoken with
him they became directly opposed. It became my
business to prove, in spite of all difficulties, that this
man, whatever the appearances, had had no hand in
the death of John Hoode. In what follows, they
who read will find, I hope, absolute proof of his
innocence; or if not that, at least a battering-ram to shake
the tower of their belief in his guilt.</p>

<p>“Knowing that Deacon was not the murderer, I
nevertheless realised that his innocence—so strong was
the case against him—could only be established by
definite proof that some one else was. That is to say:
a negative defence would be useless.</p>

<p>“It will be seen, then, that the divergence of my
opinions from those of the Crown began almost at the
outset of my investigation.</p>

<p>“Let us go back to the study at Abbotshall. On
each of the numbered points I gave earlier, I agreed
with Superintendent Boyd. Where I began to—had
to—disagree was concerning their implication of
Deacon. Points (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) can be
left alone; they will fit my murderer as well as, or
better than, they fit Deacon. The remaining two,
however, must be dealt with more fully.</p>

<p>“We will take (v) first. The obvious fact that
strength far above the normal was behind the blows
that killed Hoode was a perfect link in the chain of
circumstantial evidence against the gigantic Deacon.
But at the inquest, Dr. Fowler, the divisional surgeon,
said: ‘The wounds were inflicted so far as I can
judge, either by a man three times stronger than the
average or by a person of either sex who was insane
and had the terrible strength of the insane.’</p>

<p>“Having to find an alternative to Deacon and having
determined to cling to my theory that the murderer
was an inhabitant—permanent or temporary—of the
house, my choice of Dr. Fowler’s alternative was a
man or woman mentally unbalanced. This choice
was not, as it might at first seem, a drawback; rather
was it the reverse. For one of my first impressions
had been that there was something of terrible
senselessness about the whole affair, and this impression
had increased a thousandfold when I saw the battered
head of the dead man. Madness was my first thought
then. Those blows—<em>four</em> of them, mark you! when
the first had been obviously sufficient—surely spoke
of madness; either the lust for blood and destruction
of a confirmed homicidal maniac or <em>the consummation
of a hatred so deadly, so complete in its possession of
the hater, as to constitute of itself insanity</em>.</p>

<p>“The second was the theory I adopted. For,
believing the murderer to be an inmate of the house, it
was clear that I must look for one whose insanity was
not of a type apparent to the world.</p>

<p>“Now for point (vi)—the entry by the window.
As I have said, I agreed with the police that the
murderer did enter by the window; but there our
agreement ceased. It is a point in the crown’s case against
Deacon that his are the only legs in the house long
enough to enable their owner to clear the flower-bed
in stepping from the flagged path to the low sill of the
study window. This, I am sure, is, as evidence against
Deacon, more than useless. I have not taken measurements,
but it is obvious that even for his long legs,
a step right into the study would be impossible. This
being so, the fact that he could step on to the
window-sill is of no importance whatever. For one thing, it
would have been extremely difficult for him to retain
balance; for another, if he had retained his balance, the
necessary scrabbling at the window and the twisting and
turning he would have had to perform to get legs
and then body into the room would have attracted
Hoode’s attention before he could see enough of the
intruder to recognise him. And then the theory,
agreed by the police, that Hoode did not rise from, or
anyhow did not remain long out of, his chair, falls
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Now let us get back to my murderer. Yes, he
got in by the window; but he left the flower-bed
unmarked. Now, as he is a member of the household
we know that his legs cannot be as long as Deacon’s.
How, then, did he approach the window?</p>

<p>“He must have (<i>a</i>) jumped over the flower-bed and
into the room; (<i>b</i>) stepped on the flower-bed, but, on
leaving, repaired or disguised the damage he had done;
or (<i>c</i>) <em>got his feet on to the sill and his whole self into
the room without having crossed the flower-bed</em>.</p>

<p>“It is almost impossible that he should have done
(<i>a</i>); (<i>b</i>) is unlikely, since after the murder the
murderer had no time to spare. (This is proved later.)
One is left, then, with the conviction that the real
answer lies in (<i>c</i>). This means either that the
murderer erupted through the floor or walls of the
study or that <em>he descended the wall of the house and
entered the open study window without ever reaching
the earth in his journey</em>. (Entrance through the door
is barred. Remember, we are taking Poole’s evidence
on that point as reliable.)</p>

<p>“As the murderer was presumably flesh and blood
and there was no hole in walls or floor, I fastened on
the ‘descent’ theory, which was subsequently confirmed
by an examination of the wall outside and above the
open study window. Over this wall—over the whole
house, in fact—the commonest and creepiest of creepers
creeps. I refer to <i lang="la">Ampelopsis Veitchii</i>. A large
drainage-pipe runs to earth beside the study window
in question, and for a space of perhaps half a foot on
each side of it throughout its length the creeper has
been cleared away. But half-way between the top of
the window through which the murderer entered the
study and the first-floor windows above it, a shoot of
creeper has pushed its way out into the cleared space
beside the pipe. This shoot drew my attention because
it was black and shrivelled.</p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Ampelopsis Veitchii</i>, though one of the commonest
forms of creeper, is also one of the most tender. A
sharp blow upon the main branch of a shoot: means
death to that shoot within a few hours. The dead
piece of creeper I refer to was, I thought at first, at
that point on the wall where it might have been struck
by the feet of a man of middle height climbing out
of either of the first-floor windows over the open one
of the study at the moment when he was clutching
the sill with one or both hands and hanging with
arms bent.</p>

<p>“It was, I saw, clearly impossible for the murderer
to have dropped from the upper window on to the
sill of the open study window and so miraculously to
have retained his balance that he did not fall on to the
flower-bed. Also—in spite of the novelists—there are
few drain-pipes which can be used to climb by. This
drain-pipe is no exception. Fingers could not be
clasped round it; neither would it support more than
a five or six-stone weight. It was clear, therefore,
that the murderer, in descending the wall, had used
something to climb down—probably a rope. (Descent
of the wall was another confirmation of the theory
that the murderer was of the house.)</p>

<p>“It will have been noticed that I have used the
masculine personal pronoun to describe the murderer.
Dr. Fowler’s statement at the inquest, which I quoted
earlier, would allow, given insanity, of equal rights
to women. But I <em>felt</em>, from the beginning, that John
Hoode had been killed by a man, and I worked throughout
on that assumption. At every turn little things
told me that this was a man’s work; and I was finally
satisfied when I accepted the theory of descent by the
wall.</p>

<p>“I will bring to an end here the first part of this
report. But before starting upon the next, I will
summarise the conclusions already shown, give them
life with a touch of imagination, and let you see the
picture.</p>

<p>“The murder was committed by a man who, if not
completely mad, was at least insane in his hatred of
Hoode and Hoode’s. He was at the time of the
murder an inmate of Abbotshall. He effected entrance
to the study that night by letting himself down from
the more easterly of the first-floor windows over the
most easterly of the study windows. He spoke to
Hoode, jokingly explaining his unceremonious entry.
By some pretext (it would, you know, be easy enough)
he got behind Hoode as he sat at his big table. Then
he struck.</p>

<p>“His object achieved, he carries out the plan he has
been hatching for weeks. He sets the scene,
overturning chairs, spilling papers, dragging the body to
the hearth—and all as quietly as you please. He
steps back, to regard with pleasure the result of his
labours.</p>

<p>“He overturns the clock, having moved the sofa
to rest it upon. He moves back the hands of the
clock until they stand at 10.45. A quarter to eleven,
mark you! Not ten to, not twenty to, not twenty-three
and a half minutes to—but a quarter to!</p>

<p>“He gives a hasty glance round the room. Every
thing is in order. He thrusts his head cautiously from
the window. All is as he had calculated: there is
nobody about; the night is sufficiently dark. He goes
up his rope again and through that first-floor window.</p>

<p class="headline">II</p>

<p>“Having established our criminal as at least a
monomaniac and an inhabitant—permanent or
temporary—of the house, let us go further into detail.</p>

<p>“First, as regards the finger-prints of which so much
has been heard and so few have been seen.</p>

<p>“Every one is satisfied that the murderer wore
gloves, because nowhere else in the study, where he
must have handled one thing after another, were any
finger-prints found. They are found, these important
pieces of evidence, upon the one object where their
presence is utterly damning—and there only!</p>

<p>“The spirals, whorls, and what-nots which compose
these marks correspond exactly with those to be found
in the skin and thumb and first two fingers of Archibald
Deacon’s right hand. <i lang="la">Ergo</i>, say Police and Public,
Archibald Deacon is the murderer. But I say that
these finger-prints go a long way to prove (even
without the rest of my evidence) that Deacon <em>cannot</em> be the
murderer.</p>

<p>“Here is the one really clever murder (of those
discovered) committed within the last fifteen years.
Yet, if one take the popular view, one has to believe
that the murderer, who was wise enough to wear
gloves during the greater part of the time he was in
the study, actually removed one of them and carefully
pressed his thumb and fingers upon the highly
receptive surface of his weapon’s handle before leaving that
weapon in a nice easy place for the first policemen to
find!</p>

<p>“Surely the fallacy of blindly accepting as the
murderer the man who made those prints is obvious?
Consider the <em>position</em> of the marks. They point down
the handle, towards the blade! It is almost incredible
that at any time would the murderer have held the
weapon as a Regency buck dandled his tasselled cane.</p>

<p>“My difficulty was to reconcile with Deacon’s
innocence of the murder the presence of his
finger-prints upon the tool with which it was committed.
That the prints were his I had too much respect for the
efficacy of the Scotland Yard system to doubt.</p>

<p>“A possible solution came to me from memory of
a detective story<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="pginternal">²</a> I once read, in which the murderer,
something of a practical scientist, made, by means of
an ingenious and practicable photographical process, a
die of another’s man’s thumb-print. This he used to
incriminate the innocent owner of the thumb.</p>

<p>“For a while I cherished this theory, so vivid was
my recollection of the possibility of the method; but
I was never really satisfied. Then, suddenly, I found
the explanation which I was afterwards to prove true.</p>

<p><em>“Instead of going to the immense trouble of making
a stamp or die, why not obtain beforehand upon the
desired object the <em>actual</em> finger-prints of the chosen
scapegoat?</em></p>

<p>“After consideration, I accepted this idea. It fitted
well enough with my murderer—a fellow of infinite
cunning. I proceeded with the work of reconstruction.
Thus:—</p>

<p>“Since Deacon had no knowledge of the crime, the
murderer must have induced him, in circumstances so
ordinary or usual as to be likely to escape his memory,
to take hold of the wood-rasp by its handle at some time
before the murder; perhaps eight hours, probably not
more. For this clever murderer would realise the
difficulty of retaining the finger-prints unspoiled.</p>

<p>“When, after obtaining the finger-prints, he had got
rid of Deacon, he must have removed with gloved
hands—taking care not to touch those parts of the
handle where the prints must be—the handle he had
loosened before Deacon had held it. Then that handle
must have been packed (say in a small box with cork
wedges) in such a way as to ensure that its carriage in
the pocket for the descent of the wall and subsequent
activities could be effected without those beautiful marks
being spoiled. The reassembling of the tool must have
been done after the murder; and the whole Deacon-damning
bit of evidence then planted for the police to
find.</p>

<p>“In the study, on a later visit, I found confirmation
of the accuracy of my deductions. It will be
remembered that when the wood-rasp was produced at the
inquest, it was proved to the satisfaction of the court that
it was indeed the weapon which had caused Hoode’s
death. This proof lay pre-eminently in the condition of
the blade, which was far from nice. But it was also
pointed out by the police, to make the jury’s assurance
doubly sure, that on a little rosewood table in the study
there was a scar on the polish, known not to have
existed before, which had obviously been made by the
blade of just such a wood-rasp as this wood-rasp.
Superintendent Boyd gave it as his opinion that the
murderer had laid the wood-rasp on this table after he had
killed Hoode, and while he was arranging the
appearance of a struggle.</p>

<p>“I agree with the superintendent—but only up to a
point. Where he was wrong was in assuming that the
scar had been made by the murderer having put down
on the table the <em>whole</em> wood-rasp.</p>

<p>“That scar is of exactly the same length as the <em>blade</em>
of the rasp, and is in the centre of the table, having on
every side of it some six inches of unscarred table-top.</p>

<p>“Do you see? That scar <em>could not have been made
by the complete tool</em>! The handle is two and a half
to three inches in circumference, and if it had been
joined to the blade would, by reason of its far greater
thickness, <em>have allowed no more than an inch or so
of the blade’s tip to touch and scar the table</em>. Had
the complete rasp been laid down at an edge of the
table with the handle projecting into space, the
full-length scar would have been possible. But the scar,
as I have described, is in the middle of the table, and
could therefore only have been made by the blade
without its handle.</p>

<p>“Here, then, was the justification of my theory.
Further proof came later. With full official permission
I examined the wood-rasp. It was as it had been
found. I held it in my hand. I shook it—and the
blade flew off. Two small wooden wedges fell to the
floor. I picked a shred of linen from the tang of the
blade.</p>

<p>“Obviously, the use of the little wedges had been
to hold the tang of the blade in the enlarged socket
of the handle. And the fact that the socket had been
enlarged, added to the inadequacy of the wedges, is
surely proof enough that the blows which killed Hoode
were struck with the blade alone. There is, however,
yet more—the shred of linen. It came, I should say,
from a handkerchief, the use of which had been, I
take it, to get a better grip of the thin tang when
striking. The glove the murderer was undoubtedly
wearing probably proved insufficient to ensure against
a slipping grip. So he wrapped a handkerchief about
his gloved hand. An inequality in the surface of the
steel caught some loose thread. This he did not notice
when hastily ramming handle and blade together after
the kill.</p>

<p>“The wedges and the shred of linen are in the
keeping of Superintendent Boyd, to whom I gave them at
the time of my discovery. I could not, my case
being incomplete, explain then their significance.</p>

<p>“My next step was to question Deacon. To my
surprise and consternation I found that although he
was a man for whom tools had neither interest nor
meaning and for whom therefore the handling of any
such implement might be so much out of the ordinary
as to impress itself upon his memory, he had no
recollection of ever seeing, before the inquest, any
wood-rasp. He even suggested that until now he had not
known such a tool to exist.</p>

<p>“I will not deny that Deacon’s emphatic assertion
that he had never even seen the rasp until it was
exhibited at the inquest gave me a shaking. It did,
and a bad one. I tested all the links in my chain,
only to find each sound and the whole most obviously
right—until this blind alley.</p>

<p>“Then it struck me, and I laughed at myself as
those who read are probably already laughing at me.
I saw that I was committing the grave error of
underrating my man. I saw that so far from having
received a check I had really been advanced.</p>

<p>“The finger-prints were on the handle of the rasp,
and the handle—had I not been at much pains to prove
it—had been separated from the blade by the murderer.
The murderer—being an intelligent murderer—would
certainly never have been such a fool as to let the
fearsome and so-likely-to-be-remembered blade within
Deacon’s sight. No, it was far more likely that he
had disguised the handle as the handle of something
else.</p>

<p>“Having got thus far, I progressed at speed. As
what could he have disguised the handle? With
efficacy, only as that of another tool. But he probably
knew Deacon as a man who had no truck with tools.
How, then, did he get the so-ordinary surroundings
necessary to prevent awkward memories arising
afterwards in the mind of Deacon? The answer is that they
were there, ready-made, to his hand. In order to avoid
obscurity, I will elucidate this.</p>

<p>“The indication all through had been that the
murderer was a man accustomed to the use of
carpenter’s tools. The murderer was an inmate of the house.
Put one and two together and you will see that he
would very possibly be known to the household as one
who was ‘always messing about at that there
carpent’ring.’ Deacon was also of the household, and
would therefore see nothing unusual in, say, being
asked to ‘hold this chisel (or gouge, or anything else
you like) for just half a second.’ If this seem
far-fetched, remember that from the beginning I felt the
murderer as one who had been preparing his work for
some long time.</p>

<p>“It was almost at the moment when I reached this
stage of thought that a number of hitherto insufficiently
substantiated suspicions which had been steadily
massing in my mind suddenly rearranged themselves in
such a manner as to become extra links in my chain
of reasoning rather than the wild plungings of a mind
tired of logic. This merging of reason with intuition
(they are twins, those two) left me certain that I
should know who I was trying to prove guilty if
Deacon gave me the name of the man against whom
these suspicions of mine had been directed in answer
to the question: ‘Who, at any time within the last
twenty-four hours preceding the murder, induced you
to hold in your right hand an implement with a short,
thick wooden handle of the same appearance as the
handle you have seen in the wood-rasp?’</p>

<p>“You see, I had already learned that of the
Abbotshall <i lang="fr">ménage</i> four men frequently used, and had
consequent access to, carpenter’s tools. These were
the gardener, the chauffeur, the murdered man, and
the guest from whom I had the information.</p>

<p>“Hoode, the gardener, and the chauffeur I
disregarded. The first because he was not his own
murderer; the second because at the time of the
murder he was in bed at the Cottage Hospital in
Marling; and the third because he has respectable and
trustworthy friends to swear that he spent the evening
of the crime in their company.</p>

<p>“Remained the guest—that enthusiastic amateur
Dædalus—and he the man that from the beginning
had excited those nebulous suspicions I have mentioned.
He was living in the house at the time when the
murder was committed. He was, by his own showing,
an amateur carpenter of experience and enthusiasm.
(Early he simulated ignorance as to the name of a
wood-rasp. Later, by his voluntary statement, he
showed that he could not have been ignorant of it.
This was the only slip he made when talking with me.)</p>

<p>“Before I took opportunity to ask Deacon the
all-important question, I did much and thought more.
With one exception, these thoughts and actions are
proper to the next part of this report, and accordingly
are dealt with there. The exception is this:—</p>

<p>“I became aware that of the two first-floor windows
of Abbotshall which (see Part I.) are over the
window through which the murderer entered the study,
the more easterly must have been the one used by the
murderer. For I saw what I had not seen at first,
that it would be almost an impossibility for a man
descending by a rope from the other window to swing
his legs, at the end of the descent, on to the sill of the
study window, since that window is not exactly,
as one would find in a house younger and less altered
than Abbotshall, between the two first-floor windows
above it but has most of its length beneath the more
easterly. Moreover, although a man descending from
the less easterly window might possibly have struck
with his foot that one shoot of creeper in the cleared
space beside the drain-pipe (see Part I.), he would
also be bound to do damage to the main body of the
creeper—and that is uninjured.</p>

<p>“It was, in fact, obvious that the murderer had come
out of the room with the more easterly window. (I
was annoyed with myself for not having seen this
sooner.)</p>

<p>“That window is to the room occupied as a
sitting-room by Sir Arthur Digby-Coates.</p>

<p>“My suspect amateur carpenter was Sir Arthur
Digby-Coates.</p>

<p>“When at last I put to Deacon my question of
who had given him any implement with a wooden
handle to hold, the answer was: ‘Sir Arthur
Digby-Coates.’</p>

<p>“(<i>Note.</i>—Before going on to Part III, it might be
well to explain briefly the circumstances in which
Deacon was induced to leave the prints of his fingers
on the handle. It is not essential, but may be of
interest. Deacon, when I asked him my question,
explained that on the morning of the day of the
murder he passed by Digby-Coates’s sitting-room.
The door was open. Digby-Coates called to him to
come in. He entered to find, as <em>on several previous
occasions</em>, that Digby-Coates was amusing himself
with the completing of an excellent carved cabinet
he had been engaged on for many weeks. Digby-Coates
was in difficulties, having, he explained, too few
hands. Deacon was asked to stand by. He did so,
and assisted the enthusiast by handing from the
carpenter’s bench near the window, one tool after the
other. Among them was one, he just remembered,
with a handle such as I had described and such as he
remembered the wood-rasp handle to be now that he
came to think of it.)</p>

<p>“So there you are. When I heard the story I felt,
I confess, no little admiration for Digby-Coates.
He is so thorough! You see, this was not the first
time Deacon had given such assistance. And he knew
Deacon thought little and cared less about the whole
business of cabinet-making.</p>

<p class="headline">III</p>

<p>“It is evidence purely of trivialities which has put
Deacon in a cell awaiting trial; yet I am convinced
that did I attempt to establish his innocence merely
by the means I have employed so far, the very people
who already accept his guilt as certain would accuse
me of having nothing but trivialities upon which to
base my version of the affair. Further, it could be
said—and would be—that I have read between the
lines writing which was not there; that I have so
ingeniously twisted the interpretation of what are, in
fact, merely ordinarily meaningless signs as to make
them appear a grim and coherent indictment against
another man; that I have seen an anarchist bomb in
a schoolboy’s snowball and a Bolshevik outrage in a
varsity rag.</p>

<p>“So I must strengthen my case; for the truth is
that this evidence of trivialities is good, but not nearly
good enough. It must have a backing to it.</p>

<p>“Now, there is, if you look at it, a complete absence
of any backing to the case against Deacon. ‘What
about the money?’ you say. ‘What about that
hundred pounds belonging to Hoode? There’s motive
for you!’ ‘Nonsense!’ say I. Deacon was paid six
hundred pounds a year. He had also an allowance
from his only living relative. He had been, it is
true, a little shorter of money than usual lately; but to
suggest that he would commit a murder for a hundred
pounds is absurd. A man in his position could have
raised the money in a thousand safer and less energetic
ways. No, Deacon’s story that the money was a
birthday gift from Hoode is, besides being more likely,
true. Further, it is easy of proof that Deacon and
Hoode were on the best of terms: for corroboration
apply to the Ministry of Imperial Finance and the
households of Abbotshall and 12 Seymour Square.
Further still, look at Deacon’s record and see how
rash it is to condemn him murderer with nothing more
to go upon than those too-beautiful finger-prints and a
few ragged pieces of circumstantial evidence, <em>the
two best of which were supplied—oh! so ingenously—by
Sir Arthur Digby-Coates</em>. For it was from him
that the police first learnt that Hoode had drawn a
hundred pounds in notes from his bank. And it was
through him that it became known that Deacon had
asked him the time at ten forty-five on the night of
the murder—the time to which the hands of the
clock in the study had been moved by the murderer.</p>

<p>“There being no backing to the case of the Crown
against Deacon, I saw that if I could find a stout
one for mine against Digby-Coates I should score
heavily.</p>

<p>“The first thing to be found was motive. What,
I asked myself, could it be? Money? No. Digby-Coates
is a wealthier man by far than ever was Hoode.
Revenge for some particular ill turn? Hardly that,
since Hoode, though a politician, bore all his life
the stamp of honesty and straight dealing. A woman?
I was not prepared to accept one as the sole cause.
She might, of course, be contributory, but I wanted
something more likely. Middle-aged men of the
social and intellectual standing of these two do not
often, in this age of decrees nisi and cold love, go
about killing each other over a woman if she is only
the first blot upon the fair sea of their friendship.</p>

<p>“I was forced back, in this search for motive, upon
the deductions I had made from those little material
signs, and remembered that I had determined, before
ever I thought of putting a name to the murderer, that
John Hoode was killed by a man insane; not mad in the
gibbering, straws-in-the-hair sense, but mentally
unbalanced by a kind of ingrowing, self-nourishing
hatred.</p>

<p>“I took this as my starting point and asked myself
how I could find corroboration of and reason for this
hatred having existed in the heart of a man ostensibly
the closest friend of its object. The answer was:
look at their past history; as much of it as is available
in books of record. I did so, using Hoode’s own
books.</p>

<p>“I found soon enough reason for the hatred. Look
as I looked. You will see that always, always, always
was Digby-Coates beaten by the man he killed. Were
the race one of scholarship, sport, politics, social
advancement, honours, the result was the same. Hoode
first; Digby-Coates second. Look in the <i>Who’s Who,
Hansard</i>, the records of Upchester School and
Magdalen, the Honours Lists. Look in the minds of the
men’s colleagues and contemporaries. Always will
you find the same story. Look at this, the slightest
extract from the list:—</p>

<p>“One could go on for pages, for ever telling this
story of races won by a stride—Hoode the winner,
Digby-Coates his follower-up—and that stride getting
longer and longer as time went on.</p>

<p>“But at last came the race for the Woman—the race
whose loss snapped the last cord of sanity in the mind
of the loser.</p>

<p>“I discovered the existence of the Woman in this
way: I searched Hoode’s desk in suspicion of a
hidden drawer. I found one and in it a diary (of
no use save to corroborate the fact of some of those
races), and a bunch of newspaper-cuttings. But I
knew—how is no matter—that something was missing
from that drawer.</p>

<p>“What that something was I did not know. I only
knew that it was most probably of importance. So
I searched the house—and found it. A packet of
letters from the Woman. As I was by then up to
the neck in the unspeakable nasty work of the Private
Inquiry Agent, I read them. Who the woman is will
not be set down here. It is my hope that not even in
court shall I have to give her name.</p>

<p>“I sought her and talked with her. Put briefly and
brutally her replies were that I was correct in assuming
that she had been Hoode’s mistress, and that I was also
right (this was a shot in black dark) in assuming
that she knew Sir Arthur Digby-Coates. She did
not, it seemed, have any affection for the gentleman.
She made it plain to me, under some pressure, that Sir
Arthur had wished her to stand in the relation to him
that she subsequently did to John Hoode. But a
(shrug of distaste) Sir Arthur had been sent
packing—and quickly.</p>

<p>“Is not that enough, when added to those other and
perpetual defeats of the past five-and-thirty years, to
show the reason for hatred in the mind of the egoist?
Consider the history of the matter. First, boyish
jealousy and a determination to win next time; then the
gradual process of realisation that strive as he would
he would never reach a common goal before his rival;
then the slow at first but increasingly fast transition
from healthy jealousy to dislike, from dislike to utter
hatred. Then, at last, with the crowning loss of the
Woman, the monomania—for this is what the hatred
is grown—takes a firmer hold and becomes a fire so
fierce that only the complete elimination of the hated
man will quench it.</p>

<p>“So much for reasons why Digby-Coates should have
hated Hoode. Now for corroboration that such hatred
actually existed.</p>

<p>“I wrote just now of certain newspaper-cuttings
which I found in the hidden drawer of Hoode’s desk.
These were a bunch of twenty-four, taken from
various issues (all bearing dates within the last two
years) of <i>The Searchlight</i>, <i>The St. Stephen’s Gazette</i>,
and <i>Vox Populi</i>. Every one of the cuttings was
a leading or almost equally prominent article attacking
the Minister of Reconstruction in no half-hearted
way.</p>

<p>“Being one who prefers news without sensationalism,
I had never before read a line from any one of these
three papers. I came to these extracts, therefore, with
a mind not only open but blank, and was immediately
struck by the strange unanimity of the three newspapers
in regard to John Hoode. For, as all the world must
know, whether they read them or not, the trio are of
politics widely varying. Their attacks upon the
murdered man were made upon different grounds, it is true,
but the very fact that the attacks were made, and made
so viciously, struck me as unusual. It seemed to me
that in the ordinary way the fact of one attacking
would be enough to make at least one of the others
defend. Further, the grounds upon which the attacks
were made appeared to my unbiased mind as flimsy
compared with the whole-hearted virulence of the
writing.</p>

<p>“From wondering and re-reading, I came upon a
thing yet stranger: the unmistakable and mysterious
similarity in the style of the composition. This
similarity was to me, who have made something of a study
of other men’s methods, even more pronounced when
attempts had been made to disguise or vary the manner
of writing. After ten minutes’ examination of those
cuttings, I was prepared to swear that one man had
been conducting the anti-Hoode campaign in three
papers whose views on every other matter from
vaccination to the Vatican are as wide apart as Stoke
Poges, Seattle, and Sinbad the Sailor. I pictured a
man of some scholastic attainment who was unable to
write in fashion other than preciously correct and so
set in his style as to be incapable of varying it, tried he
never so hard.</p>

<p>“I took the cuttings and my conviction to Deacon.
He could not help me, so I went to his predecessor as
Hoode’s private secretary (the real private secretary,
like Deacon, not the departmental one.) From him I
obtained confirmation of my theory. He, too, had
suspected that not only was one man behind these press
attacks, but that this man was also the actual author. He
showed me something I had only half-noticed till then;
something which went further than mere similarity of
style. Throughout the articles, he pointed out,
quotations occurred. They were, some of them, unusual
quotations. But usual or unusual, one and all were
correct! They were correct in some cases to the point
of pedantry—if correctness can be so described. And
they were thus correct in these three widely differing
and highly sensational papers, whose literary standards
have always been a byword with those who hate
journalese, <i lang="fr">cliché</i>, and the dreadful mutilation,
humiliation and weakening of the English language.</p>

<p>“It was when this former secretary of Hoode’s
pointed this out to me that I recollected having recently
been puzzled by a memory which would not be
remembered. In one of the cuttings I had come
across a quotation from Virgil, in which a dative case
had been used rather than the all-prevalent but less
correct genitive, and had been haunted at the time of
reading with a sense of having seen this same rarity only
recently. Suddenly it came back to me. It had been
in a book of essays I had dipped into—a book of essays
which, on inquiry made later, turned out to be from
the pen of Sir Arthur Digby-Coates, writing under
a feminine nom de guerre.</p>

<p>“That, I admit, is not much to go upon. But more
was to come. This forerunner of Deacon had—before
he quarrelled with Hoode and left him—on
his own initiative employed a private detective and set
him to unearth this enemy of Hoode’s that seemed to
command and write for three incendiary newspapers.
You see, this secretary was sure that there was an
enemy of some importance at work. At first he said
nothing to Hoode, but at last told of his suspicions.
He was laughed at. He returned to the charge—and
they quarrelled. He left Hoode’s employment without
having told him of the private detective. Being, with
some excuse, not a little angry, he paid the detective,
telling him to stop the work and go to hell.</p>

<p>“But, luckily, the private detective had smelt a Big
Thing, and consequently Big Money. He went on
working. He finished his job. I got into touch with
him. He has been paid, and the result of his labours
has been forwarded to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>“His proofs are more than adequate. He has
established, mainly through the corruptibility of a
disgruntled employee, that Digby-Coates was beyond doubt the
hidden owner of those three newspapers and also the
composer of all these elaborate pæans of hate which
appeared in them from time to time, and were directed
against the man who was his friend and whose
friendship he so cleverly pretended to return. (One cannot
but admire the ingenuity with which Digby-Coates
foisted more or less respectable and quite foolish
figureheads upon the world—including the rest of the
Press—as owners of the papers upon the purchase and
upkeep of which he must have spent nearly half his
great fortune. He was truly a great Enemy!)</p>

<p>“But it was in himself writing the attacks with which
he tried to bring Hoode to a fall that he overstepped
himself and made a loophole through which curious
persons could wriggle. Had he left the writing to
different men and rested content with being the power
behind the machine, he would have increased by a
thousand his chances of remaining undiscovered. I
suppose that his hate was so strong that to leave
to others the forging of the weapons was beyond
him.</p>

<p>“Before ending the third part of this report, I
would draw attention to what has thus far been
established—established, I hope, to the satisfaction of even
the most rigorous anti-Deaconite.</p>

<p>“It has been shown that there is both reason for
and corroboration of Digby-Coates’s hatred of Hoode.</p>

<p>“It has been shown not only that all the evidence
against Deacon can be used equally well against
Digby-Coates, but also that there is in fact more of this
evidence of material signs against Digby-Coates than
there is against Deacon.</p>

<p>“Above all, we have in the case against Digby-Coates
two things (which might be called one thing)
that there have never been against Deacon. The first
is motive—although it is nothing more (nor less) than
the crazy hatred of a half-madman. The second is
reliable evidence that ill-will existed before the murder.</p>

<p class="headline">IV</p>

<p>“If I were delivering this report as a lecture, I am
sure that there would be a little fat man in a corner
bounding up and down with ill-suppressed irritation.
At this stage he would be unable to restrain himself
any longer and would ask passionately why the hell I
was wasting my time and his by faking up a case
against a man who had a chilled-steel alibi—the
perfect, unassailable defence of a man who is seen by
various people at such times and in such a place as
to make it impossible for him to have committed the
crime.</p>

<p>“I would assure the fat little man—as I assure
those who read—that I would in due course deal with
and demolish that alibi, pointing out at the same time
that it was the very perfection of the thing which
had bred some of my first suspicions of its owner.
It was too good, too complete, in a household where
every one else had only ordinary ones; it was a
Sunday-go-to-meeting alibi; the alibi of a man who at
least knew that a crime was going to be committed.</p>

<p>“But more of that later. For the moment I will
take two points which, though they might be considered
proper to the first part of this document, I have
seen fit to reserve until now.</p>

<p>“The first concerns a rope. I have explained that
I found it necessary to search the house. During that
search, which was not only for the missing letters from
the drawer in Hoode’s writing-table, I went into
Deacon’s bedroom. This is next to, and on the west
side of, the room used by Digby-Coates as a sitting-room,
study, and, occasionally, carpenter’s shop. (He
has had a bench fitted up there for him, as I mentioned
earlier.)</p>

<p>“In the grate in Deacon’s bedroom was a little pile
of soot which at once attracted my attention, as being
unusual in so scrupulously tended a house as
Abbotshall. I investigated. On the ledge which runs round
the interior of the chimney at the point where—on
a level with the mantelpiece outside—it suddenly
narrows, I found a coil of silk cord of roughly the
thickness of a man’s little finger. It was double-knotted
at intervals of two inches throughout its length,
which was sixteen feet. (By the time this report is
read the rope will be in the hands of the
authorities. They would have had it sooner, only I was not
giving away information until my case was complete.)</p>

<p>“That pile of soot in the grate was not of long
standing. The cord was new. I knew at once that
I had found the rope by which my criminal had
descended the wall. But how did it get where I
found it?</p>

<p>“I saw that the only answer which would fit the
rest of my case was that the rope had been put there
by Digby-Coates. Since I knew Deacon to be innocent
and I had nowhere found any evidence to show that
Digby-Coates had an accomplice, it could have been
nobody else. And it was so easy for him, occupying
as he did the room next to Deacon’s.</p>

<p>“I am aware that here I am treading on dangerous
ground—from the point of view, that is, of the
logical anti-Deaconite—but I say nevertheless that this
business of the rope strengthens my case and goes to
give yet further indication of Digby-Coates’s
deliberate plan to fasten his guilt upon Deacon. Silk rope
of so excellent a quality is not common, and I think
that Scotland Yard should have little difficulty in
tracing its purchase. So convinced am I that they
will find Digby-Coates at the other end of the trail that,
if I could be of any use, I would willingly help them.
Without the rest of my investigations, the finding of
that rope would only have hastened Deacon’s journey
to another and thicker one. But with them it has an
effect most different.</p>

<p>“Now for the second matter which was to be dealt
with before the alibi.</p>

<p>“It will be remembered that a great point against
Deacon was that the hands of the overturned clock
in the study stood at 10.45. The coroner, in reviewing
the case at the end of the inquest, argued thus: At
a quarter to eleven Deacon had entered the room of
Sir Arthur Digby-Coates and inquired the time. That
he had done so was apparent both from the evidence
of Sir Arthur and of Deacon himself. All the other
evidence pointed to Deacon: Was it not then only
reasonable to assume that Deacon, after committing the
murder and arranging the room to look as if a struggle
had taken place, had pushed those hands back to 10.45,
knowing that at that time he had been with so reputable
a witness as Sir Arthur Digby-Coates? The whole
thing was clear, said the coroner, answering his own
question and practically directing the already willing
jury to pass a verdict against Deacon.</p>

<p>“The coroner added that he could not say whether,
if his assumption were correct, which he was sure it
was, Deacon had asked the time of Sir Arthur Digby-Coates
in order to be able, by moving the clock, to
establish an alibi, or whether that request for the time
had been an accident and the moving of the clock
hands a subsequent idea brought about by memory
of the ‘time’ incident. In any case, added this erudite
official, the omission to make a corresponding alteration
in the chiming served to show how the cleverest
criminal will always make some foolish mistake which
will afterwards lead to his capture.</p>

<p>“How true! How trite! And, in this instance,
how utterly wrong! Observe. Both Digby-Coates
and Deacon are highly intelligent men. Suppose
either of them wishing to show by moving back the
hands of a clock that the clock stopped at a time
earlier than it did in fact: would either make the
ridiculous, childish mistake of forgetting the striking?
I think not!</p>

<p>“Observe again. Two men know that one asked
the other the time. Why, then, is the subsequent
utilising of that incident to be attributed to only one
of them? Clearly it can apply equally to both!</p>

<p>“Here again the evidence which has been used
against Deacon can be used at least equally well against
Digby-Coates.</p>

<p>“This clock business, I say, is only further proof of
the great ingenuity of Digby-Coates. It was the
cleverest stroke of all. Deacon innocently, naturally,
asks him the time. At once Digby-Coates, having
already made up his mind that to-night was the night,
is seized with an idea whose brilliance is surprising
even to himself. Deacon, the man he has already
chosen as scapegoat, is playing into his hands.</p>

<p>“Suppose (I can see his mind working) that he
slew Hoode just on the hour, and then made sure,
after the clock in the study had struck, that its works,
though undamaged, would not go on working, and
then moved the hands back till they stood at 10.45.
The disorder of the striking when the clock was set
going again would reveal to investigators the fact that
the hands had been moved and that the clock had
stopped not before the hour but after it. Why, these
investigators, would ask, had the hands been moved
to that particular place—10.45? Soon they would
find out—he, clever fellow! helping them without
seeming to—that at this moment on the night of the
crime Deacon had asked him the time. ‘Ah-ha!’ would
say the investigators, ‘Mr. Deacon, to whom so much
else points, has been trying to make alibis for himself!’</p>

<p>“But how, he thinks, can he carry out this great,
this wonderful scheme? Ah, yes! Let him put himself
in Deacon’s place; let him think what Deacon would
do if he was killing Hoode. If he stopped the clock,
he wouldn’t draw too much attention to it, so—so—ah,
yes!—he would try to make it look as if there had
been a struggle and would derange the tidy room
accordingly!</p>

<p>“That, I am convinced, is the way Digby-Coates
reasoned. To put it briefly, he had to arrange the
study to look, not as if a struggle had really taken
place, but as if some one had tried their best to <em>make
it look like that</em>. That is to say, while giving the air
of a genuine attempt to mislead, he must yet make
sure that investigators were not, in fact, misled; the
first thing, for instance, that he had to do was to
ensure that attention was drawn to the clock, but in
such a way as to make it seem that endeavours had
been made to draw attention <em>from</em> it.</p>

<p>“Clever, you must admit. Clever as hell! And
successful, as those who have followed the case must
know. He got the effect he wanted—that of a man
who had tried to mislead. The police know that
‘struggle’ scene for a fake. But I hope I have shown
that it was a double fake. If you think I have imbued
my criminal with more ingenuity than any murderer
would possess, remember that I, too, am a man, and
therefore a potential murderer. Remember also
something of which I have given more tangible proof—the
finger-print game he played on Deacon. Remember
that it was through him that the police first learnt of
the money Hoode had drawn from his bank, and the
fact that at 10.45 on the night of the murder Deacon
had asked him the time! Remember that this business
of the clock and the ‘struggle’ is like that of the silk
cord—nothing without what I have described in the
earlier parts of this report, but with it a great deal.</p>

<p>“And now for that alibi.</p>

<p>“That the murderer was in the study after the
clock there—which, by the way, was correct by the
other clocks in the house, had struck eleven, is proved
by the fact of the striking of that clock being one
hour behind.</p>

<p>“Miss Hoode entered the study and found the body
at about ten minutes past eleven.</p>

<p>“The murderer, then, left the study at some time
between two minutes past the hour at the earliest and
ten minutes past.</p>

<p>“So soon as I was certain that the murderer was
Digby-Coates, I saw that before my case against him
was complete I must disprove his alibi; also I realised
that this could best be done by ascertaining much more
definitely at what time he left the study to climb back
up the wall and into his room. That eight minutes
between eleven-two and eleven-ten was too wide a
margin to work in.</p>

<p>“The more I pondered this task the more removed
from possibility seemed its completion. Then, by the
grace of God, there emerged, in circumstances which
need not be set down here, a new witness whose
evidence put me in possession of exactly the information
I needed.</p>

<p>“This witness is Robert Belford, a man-servant, and
therefore a permanent member of the Hoode household.
He is a highly-strung little man, and refrained at first
from telling what he knew through very natural fear
of being himself suspected of the murder of his
master.</p>

<p>“Before Belford’s emergence I had come to the
conclusion—though I could not see then how this was
going to help—that the acceptance of the old
butler—Poole—as a perfect trustworthy witness had been a
mistake. I discovered, you see, that he suffers from
that inconvenient disorder hay-fever.</p>

<p>“When in the throes of a seizure he can neither
see, hear nor speak; is conscious, in fact, of nothing
save discomfort. That these seizures last sometimes
for as long as a minute and a half I can swear to
from having watched the old man struggle with one.</p>

<p>“Immediately after my discovery of the existence
in him of this ailment, I questioned Poole; with the
result that at last he remembered having suffered a
paroxysm on the night of the murder at some time
during that part of the evening before the murder
when his master was in the study and the rest of the
house was quiet. He had not remembered the incident
until I asked him. His memory, as he says, is not
what it was, and in any case the event was not
sufficiently out of the ordinary to have stayed in his
head after all the emotions of that crowded night.</p>

<p>“But it was during, or rather at the beginning, of
that minute and a half or two minutes during which
the old man could do nothing but cough and sneeze
and choke and gasp with his head between his knees,
that Belford—the new witness—had entered the study—by
the door!</p>

<p>“When he got into the room he saw immediately
the body of his master. In one horrified second (I
have said that he is an intensely nervous, highly-strung
little man) he took it all in; corpse, disorder, and all
the other details of that brilliant and messy crime.
<em>And there was, he swears, no one else in the room.</em>
The only place in which a man could have hidden
would have been the alcove at the far end of the room,
but the curtains which, as a rule, cut that off from
view, were on that night drawn aside.</p>

<p>“Belford, after that one great second of horror,
fled. As he closed the door behind him, he noticed
that Poole, in his little room across the hall, was still
wrestling with his paroxysm. Belford retreated. He
was terrified that this dreadful crime he had seen
might be laid at his door were he seen coming from
the room. It was, to say the least, unusual that he
should enter the study when his master was working
there. Nobody, he felt, would believe him if he told
them that he had gone there to ask a favour of the
dead man. He crept up the dark hall and crouched
on the stairs.</p>

<p>“His position was directly under the clock which
hangs there; and here you have the reason for what
has possibly seemed meticulousness on my part in
describing this minor incident. He became aware,
without thinking, of what that clock said. He stared
up at it blankly. But, as often happens, this mechanical
action impresses itself on his memory. He swears—nothing
will shake his evidence—that the time was
<em>five minutes past eleven</em>.</p>

<p>“There you have it. Digby-Coates, as I have shown,
cannot have left the study before eleven-two. At
some point between eleven-four and eleven-five Belford
finds the study empty of life.</p>

<p>“I split the difference and took eleven-three as
the time at which Digby-Coates left the study—by
the window. He must have been, I argued, snugly
back in his room by four minutes past at the latest.
He is still an active and very powerful man, and the
climb could not have taken him long.</p>

<p>“Having, after hearing what Belford had to tell
me, thus been enabled to know at least a part of the
time which must prove a weak spot in the alibi, I
reviewed that itself. Before I do so, here, however,
there is one more point which I must settle. It
concerns the hay-fever of the aged Mr. Poole. As the
attack of this malady which let Belford into the study
unobserved failed to stay in his memory, it might be
thought that he may have had another attack, enabling
another man to enter the study without being seen.
That idea, which is sure to be entertained, is, I submit,
of no value. One attack is ordinary enough; but the
old man tells me that he has been ‘better lately.’ Two
of those painful seizures would have stayed in his mind.
Besides, there is the silk rope and other evidence to
prove descent by the wall. Also, the crime was
obviously premeditated, and no murderer of such skill as
Hoode’s would rely upon the hay-fever of an aged
butler, even if he knew of its existence.</p>

<p>“Now for the facts of the alibi. It will be
remembered that Digby-Coates had, on the night of the
murder, retired to his own sitting-room at a few minutes
after ten. The night was hot. He opened the window
to its fullest extent; also flung the door open. This
was (I use his own words, spoken at the inquest)
‘in order to get the benefit of any breeze there might
be.’ Further, since he ‘wished to be alone in order
to go through some important papers,’ he pinned upon
that open door a notice: ‘Busy—do not disturb.’</p>

<p>“After he had gone to his room, the first incident
with which we need concern ourselves occurred at
10.45, when Deacon made that famous request for the
time. At that moment Digby-Coates was pacing the
room, and Deacon, disregarding or not seeing the
notice on the door, put his question from the passage.</p>

<p>“About seven minutes later, Belford, walking down
the passage, saw Digby-Coates standing in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“The next we hear is from Elsie Syme, one of the
housemaids, who ‘saw Sir Arthur sitting in his big
chair by the window’ as she passed his door. (The
quotation is from her reply to a question of
Superintendent Boyd’s.) So far as can be ascertained, this
was not more than five minutes after Belford had
passed by—making the time about 10.57.</p>

<p>“Next comes another housemaid, Mabel Smith, who
had been working in the linen-closet, which is opposite
the door of Deacon’s room. She said that returning
from the journey she had made downstairs (and by
forgetting which she had furnished Deacon with that
false alibi which he rather foolishly tried to make use
of) she had noticed Sir Arthur ‘sitting in his room.’
The time then, as guessed at by the girl and more
definitely confirmed by Elsie Syme, who knew what
time she had left the servant’s hall, was between eleven
and one minute past.</p>

<p>“Next comes Belford again. You remember that
he entered the study at a point between three and four
minutes past eleven. On his way there from the upper
part of the house he passed Digby-Coates’s room and
‘saw Sir Arthur by the window.’ Since he went
straight to the study, the time at which he passed
Digby-Coates’s door cannot have been earlier than
11.03.</p>

<p>“After this we have Elsie Syme again. This time
she is on her way to bed. Passing along the passage
she again ‘saw Sir Arthur sitting by the window.’
The time in this instance is a little harder to get at,
but cannot have been more than six minutes past the
hour.</p>

<p>“Last we have the evidence of old Poole, who, after
entering the study on hearing Miss Hoode scream,
immediately fled to fetch his dead master’s friend.
He found Sir Arthur sitting with a book, his arm-chair
pulled close up to the open window. This, since
Miss Hoode entered the study at approximately ten
minutes past eleven, was probably at 11.13 or
thereabouts.</p>

<p>“That is the alibi, and a very good one it is,
too—too good. It was, of course, never recognised as
being an alibi, since Digby-Coates was never suspected
by police or public as being the murderer; but the
very fact of its being there (it trickled out mixed
up with unimportant and verbose evidence, and was
very cleverly referred to by Digby-Coates himself on
every possible occasion) must have had its sub-conscious
effect. (I should perhaps explain here that, as
Digby-Coates was never suspected and the alibi was therefore
the nebulous but effective thing I have described, the
times I have given were not mentioned otherwise than
generally: such exactitude as appears above is the
result of Superintendent Boyd’s and my own
questioning, of which more came later.)</p>

<p>“I have shown that according to the witnesses, none
of whom I could suspect of anything but honesty,
Digby-Coates was seen there in his room at times
which made it impossible that he should have done the
murder. Yet I <em>knew</em> he was the murderer. Therefore
some at least of these witnesses who had sworn
to seeing him were mistaken.</p>

<p>“I had, then, to find out (<i>a</i>) which witnesses were
thus in error, and (<i>b</i>) how they had been induced to
make their common mistake.</p>

<p>“I got at (<i>a</i>) like this: (if the way seem long and
roundabout, remember that it is far more difficult to
find things out than to understand, when told, how they
were so found out):—</p>

<p>“Digby-Coates, I reasoned, <em>must</em> have begun his
preparations immediately after Belford saw him
standing in the doorway of his room at eight minutes to
eleven. To descend the wall; to enter the study; to
hold Hoode in chaffing conversation for a moment
to allay his curiosity regarding the unusual method of
entry; to kill him; to reassemble the wood-rasp; to
set the ‘struggle’ scene; arrange the clock; to climb
back up the wall again; and all as noiseless as you
please, cannot have taken him less than eight minutes
at the very least. As I have shown, he was in all
probability back in his room by four minutes past the
hour (if not earlier) and it will be seen, therefore,
that he must have begun descent of the wall by four
minutes to at the latest.</p>

<p>“The witnesses I was after, therefore, were those
who thought they had seen him between four minutes
to and four minutes past the hour.</p>

<p>“Of these, as you can see from my statement of
the alibi, Elsie Syme is the first, Mabel Smith the
second, and Belford the third. (Elsie Syme, it is
true, might be considered as barely coming within my
rough-and-ready time-limit, but you must remember
that all the times I fixed were calculations and not
stop-watch records.)</p>

<p>“Separately, I questioned the three servants. It
was not an easy task. I had to handle them gently,
and I had to impress upon them the vital necessity
to forget the conversation as soon as they had left
me. I think I managed it.</p>

<p>“Their answers to my first important question were
the same, though each was with me alone when I
put it.</p>

<p>“I said: ‘You say you saw Sir Arthur at such
and such a time in his room on the night of the
murder, and that he was sitting in his chair and that that
chair was by the window. Are you certain of this?’</p>

<p>“They said: ‘Yes, sir,’ and said it emphatically.</p>

<p>“I played my trump card. I played it in some
fear; if the answers were not what I expected, my
case fell.</p>

<p>“I said: ‘Now tell me: <em>exactly how much of Sir
Arthur did you see?</em> What parts of him, I mean.’</p>

<p>“They goggled.</p>

<p>“I tried again: ‘Was the chair that big arm-chair?
And was it facing the window with its back
to the door?’</p>

<p>“ ‘Yes, sir,’ they said.</p>

<p>“I said: ‘Then all you saw of Sir Arthur was——’</p>

<p>“They replied, after some further help but with
conviction, that all they had seen was the top of his
head, part of his trousers, and the soles of his shoes.
Belford, who is an intelligent man, expanded his
answer by saying: ‘You see, sir, we’re all so used-like
to seein’ Sir Arthur sittin’ like that and in that
chair as we just naturally thinks as how we’d seen
all on ’im that night.’ Which, I think, is as lucid an
explanation of the mistake as could well be given.</p>

<p>“I must explain here how I came in possession of
this trump card of mine. It was through two casual
observations, which at first never struck me as bearing
in any way upon the matter I was investigating. The
first was the annoying, almost impossible tidiness of
Digby-Coates’s hair. It did not appear to be greased
or pomaded in any way, and yet I never saw it other
than as if he had just brushed it, and with care. The
second was his curious trick of sitting on the edge of
a chair with his feet thrust first backwards through
the gateway formed by the front legs and then
outwards until each instep is pressed against the back of
each of those front legs. It is a trick most boys have,
but it is unusual to find it persisting in a man of
middle-age. Digby-Coates does not, of course, always
sit like that, but frequently.</p>

<p>“What changed these two chance observations—the
sort of thing one idly notices about any man of one’s
acquaintance without really thinking about them—into
perhaps the most important minor step in my case was
a glimpse I had of Digby-Coates from the very point
from which the servants who made his alibi had seen
him. He was sitting as they had seen him sit (though
I did not know this until I questioned them) in the big
arm-chair, which was facing the window. All I could
see from the passage was the long, solid back of the
chair, the top of the well-tended head, six inches of
each trouser-leg, and the soles of two shoes. On the
open door was a notice: ‘Busy—Please do not
disturb.’</p>

<p>“The scene was, in fact, a replica of what I had
gathered it to be on the night of the murder. I fell
to thinking, and suddenly the most annoying pieces
of my jig-saw puzzle fell into place. I went in and
spoke to him. I looked, more carefully than ever
before, at his head, and came to the conclusion that he
was bald, but wore the most skilfully made <i lang="fr">toupé</i> I had
ever seen. I remembered that he had told me that he
never used a valet. I pictured him—he is the type—as
one to whom the thought that any one else knew
how unsavoury he appeared minus hair was abhorrent.</p>

<p>“When I discovered the <i lang="fr">toupé</i>, I knew that I could
smash the alibi if only the unknowing alibi-makers
gave me, honestly, the answers I wanted.</p>

<p>“As you know, they did. I consider the matter
clear, but I know it. Perhaps I had better show what
Digby-Coates did that night; how he set his stage and
played out his one-act show.</p>

<p>“He retires to his room, knowing that Hoode is
in his study, Deacon busy or, as often of late, out,
Miss Hoode and Mrs. Mainwaring in their beds, and
some of the servants, as he wishes them, moving about
the house—he has studied their movements and knows
that on this night of the week there is work to do which
keeps them later than usual. Luckily for him, the
night is hot. It gives the necessary excuse for leaving
his door as well as his window open. Upon that open
door—which is not back against the wall, but only
half open—he places a notice: ‘Busy—Please do not
disturb.’</p>

<p>“(Observe the cunning of this notice. He had,
I found from the servants, placed such a notice on
the open door on two previous occasions. This, I am
sure, he had done for a two-fold reason: (i) to see
whether it would really keep out intruders, and (ii) to
ensure, when eventually he placed it there on the night
he chose for the killing of Hoode, that though the
household were not become sufficiently accustomed to
it to avoid a glance at it and subsequently into the
room, the sight of the notice was yet familiar enough
to ensure that it was not remarkable as being without
precedent. He had, you see, for the sake of his alibi,
to make certain that people passing (i) would look
into his room; (ii) would not come in; and (iii)
would not think the notice anything out of the
ordinary.)</p>

<p>“Having placed his notice he draws his arm-chair
up to its <em>familiar</em> position facing the window. Then
he has to wait. Sometimes he sits. Sometimes, the
waiting too hard upon even such nerves as his, he paces
the room.</p>

<p>“All goes well. Every one, everything, plays into
his hands. The very man he has chosen to incriminate
draws the noose, by that request for the time, tighter
round his own neck. The leaden-footed minutes, what
with this incident, that of Belford, and the increasing
certainty of success, begin to pass more swiftly.
People go their ways past his door but do not enter.</p>

<p>“At last it is time. He gets his knotted rope,
secures it to the leg of the carpenter’s bench Hoode
has had fitted for him. The bench is clamped to the
floor; no doubt but that it can stand the strain.</p>

<p>“Now, with a wary eye upon the door, he takes
from its hiding-place the replica of the <i lang="fr">toupé</i> which
is on his head, pads it out with a handkerchief, and
sets it on top of a pile of books on the seat of the chair.
The pile is just of the height to show the hair over
the chair-back to one looking into the room from the
passage. He knows, he has tested it many times,
(He may, possibly, have used the half-wig from his
head. But I think not. He must have had more than
one; and he would not wish to have anything unusual
in his appearance when he faced Hoode. The
difficulty of explaining as a joke his entrance by the
window would be sufficient.)</p>

<p>“A pair of dress trousers pinned to the chair, the
lower ends of the legs slightly padded and twisted one
round each of the chair’s front legs, and a pair of
patent-leather shoes set at the right angle, complete the
picture.</p>

<p>“(So simple as to sound comic, isn’t it? But if
one thinks, one can see that in that simplicity lies that
same touch of genius which characterises the whole
of the other arrangements of the crime. To utilise
his own little tricks, such as that way he had of sitting
on a chair like a nervous schoolboy, that is genius. He
knew that all they could have seen of him from that
doorway, if he had really sat in his favourite position
in that chair, would have been the top of his head, the
ends of his trousers, and his shoes. He knew also
that they were so accustomed to seeing only hair,
trousers, and shoes when he was really there, that if
they saw hair, trousers, and shoes they would be
prepared to swear they had seen <em>him</em>.)</p>

<p>“When the time comes, at last, he drops his rope of
silk from the window and descends, his heart beating
high with exultation. The moment he has waited for,
schemed for, gloated over, will be with him at the end
of that short journey.… Some minutes later he returns
by the same precarious stair.</p>

<hr/>

<p>“It was the simplicity and sheer daring of the scheme
that made this the wellnigh perfect crime it was. It
was here that the maniac hatred he had of Hoode helped
him so greatly. I cannot conceive any but a man
insane running the tremendous risk of discovery which
he took with such equanimity. Nor would any but one
with the great clarity of mind only attained by the mad
have even dreamed of carrying out a crime so adult
by means of the schoolboy trick of the dummy. It was
an application of the bolster-in-the-dormitory-bed idea
which nearly succeeded by virtue of its very
unlikelihood.</p>

<p>“I have little more to say, though it would, of course,
be possible to go much further in endeavouring to show
the subtler shades of motive for each separate link of
Digby-Coates’s plot, and to go into such questions as
whether he chose Deacon as scapegoat merely for
convenience in drawing suspicion away from himself or
whether he had some darker reason; but the time for
that sort of thing is not yet.</p>

<p>“One more word. I wish to make it plain that as
a case I know this report to be less complete than is
desirable. I know that it might be impossible to hang
Digby-Coates simply upon the strength of what I have
set down. I know that in all probability the Crown
would say that, unless the case were strengthened, it
could not be regarded as enough even to try him on.
I know the later stages of the report are mainly
conjecture—guess-work if you like.</p>

<p>“I know all this, I say, but I also know that if there
is any justice in England to-day I have shown enough
of the true history of John Hoode’s death to bring
about the immediate release of Archibald Deacon.</p>

<p>“I know that Arthur Digby-Coates is guilty of the
murder of John Hoode, and, having gone so far
towards proving this beyond doubt, I intend to see him
brought to trial.</p>

<p>“The only way to bring this about is to give my work
the substantial backing of a confession by the murderer.
This I intend to obtain.</p>

<p>“I cannot but think that, if I succeed, my work is
finished and the agreement of even the most sceptical
assured.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII. <br/> Enter Fairy Godmother</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Dinner that night had been a melancholy business
for the sisters. During the day the anodyne of
action had brought them at times almost to cheerfulness;
but from the moment when they had left the
chambers of the great Marshall’s junior, their spirits
had begun steadily to evaporate.</p>

<p>Of the two, perhaps Lucia suffered the most. She
was older. She had not the ingenuousness which
enabled Dora to take at their face value the reassurance of
barristers and the like. And she suffered, though she
would barely admit it to herself, from a complication
of anxieties.</p>

<p>As the evening grew old so she grew angry and more
angry—and always with Lucia Lemesurier. She felt
something of contempt for herself. Surely a woman
of thirty—Heavens, what age!—should have more
feeling, more decency, when her little sister was in
trouble so grave, than to offer only half her mind for
the duty of consolation? Surely it was hardly—hardly
seemly for this middle-aged woman to be—well,
worrying, at such a time as this, over a petty quarrel
with a man she barely knew? Yet, yet—well, he might
have answered that note if he couldn’t come.</p>

<p>Lucia took herself in hand. This must stop! She
looked across the pretty room to where Dora lay
coiled upon a sofa, a book held before her face.</p>

<p>Lucia conceived suspicions of that book. She
investigated, to find them well-founded. The book was
upside down; the face behind it was disfigured by
tear-laden, swollen eyes.</p>

<p>Contrite, Lucia attempted consolation, and was in
a measure successful. For an hour—perhaps two—Dora
lay with her head on her sister’s breast.</p>

<p>“Feeling better, dear?” Lucia said at last.</p>

<p>Dora nodded. “I do. Really I do. Sorry ’m
such a little idiot. Only it’s—it’s—I can’t help
thinking, wondering—oh, what’s the good? Everything’s
going to be all right. It’s got to be! It <em>must</em> be!”</p>

<p>“Of course it will.” Lucia stroked the red-gold
hair.</p>

<p>Dora sat upright, hands pressed to flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>“Don’t know why I’m behaving in such a <em>damn’</em>
silly way!” she burst out. “You ought to shake me,
darling, instead of being so sweet. Look at Archie.
He’s wonderful! And he’d hate it if he knew I was
slobbering here like a nasty schoolgirl. He says it’ll
be all right! And so does Colonel Gethryn.”</p>

<p>Lucia drew away; then silently reviled herself.
Why, why in Heaven’s name, should mention of this
man affect her?</p>

<p>But Dora went on. Dora was no fool, and Dora
was interested. A good thing for Dora; for a
moment it lifted from her that black pall of brooding
fear.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you surprised, Loo, when Archie told us
this morning about Mr. Gethryn really being Colonel
Gethryn? And all those wonderful things he did in
the war with the Secret What-d’you-call-it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lucia absently. Then hurried
mendaciously to correct herself. “Yes, I mean. I was
surprised. Very much!” She felt a hot flush mount
to her cheeks. This did not lesson her annoyance with
Lucia Lemesurier.</p>

<p>Came a silence, broken at last by the younger
sister.</p>

<p>“I,” she said, with a gallant attempt at frivolity,
“am going to repair to my chamber, there to remove
traces of these ignoble tears.” And she hurried from
the room.</p>

<p>Lucia stared a moment at the closed door; then sank
back into the softness of the couch. Her thoughts
cannot be described with any clarity. They were, as
may be imagined, again a jumble. One moment she
would smile at some secret thought; another would find
her tense, pale, vivid imagination of horrors to come
to her sister and her sister’s lover possessing her.</p>

<p>Would everything, as she had so confidently said,
be “all right”? Would miracles indeed be worked
by this—by Colonel Gethryn? How absurd the
“Colonel” sounded! Colonels, surely, were purple, fat,
and white-moustached, not tall, lean, “hawky” persons
with disturbing green eyes.</p>

<p>She was startled from her reverie. Had she
heard anything? Yes, there it was again—a tapping
on the window. The thunder had stopped now, and
the sound came sharply through the soft hissing of
the rain.</p>

<p>There is always something sinister in a knocking
upon a window. With a jump one exchanges the dull
safety of ordinary life for the uncomfortable
excitement of the sensational novel. Lucia, her nerves
wrecked by the emotions of the past week and further
jarred by the noise of the storm, sprang to her feet
and stood straining her eyes, wide, startled and black
as velvet shadows, towards the French windows.</p>

<p>The tapping came again, insistent. She took hold
of her courage, crossed the room, and flung them
open.</p>

<p>Anthony stepped across the sill. He was, as he had
left Mr. Lucas ten minutes before, without hat or
mackintosh. He seemed, as indeed he was, serenely
unconscious of his appearance. But the pallor of
fatigue, the blazing eyes, the labouring breath, the
hatless head shining with wet, the half-sodden clothes,
all had their effect upon Lucia. It had been for her an
evening of horror. Now, surely, here was news of
worse.</p>

<p>Her eyes questioned him. Her heart hammered at
her breast. Speech she found impossible.</p>

<p>Anthony bowed. “Enter Fairy Godmother,” he
said. “Preserve absolute calm. The large Mr.
Deacon is a free man. Repentant policemen are busy
scouring his ’scutcheon. I think it not unlikely that he
will be here within an hour or so.”</p>

<p>Lucia was left without breath. “Oh—why—what——”
she gasped.</p>

<p>He smiled at her. “Please preserve absolute calm.
My nerves aren’t what they were. What do we do
next? Tell little sister, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“You—I—I——” she stammered, and rushed from
the room.</p>

<p>Anthony, having first covered the seat with a
convenient newspaper, sank into a chair.</p>

<p>He communed with himself. “Lord, I’m wet!
How is it that I can be melodramatic as well? I
must curb this passion for effect. Still, it kept her
off any expressions of gratitude and the like. Good
God! Gratitude! It’s not that I want. And what
do I want? All. Yes, all! But I must go softly.
One must wait.” He shook himself. “And anyhow,
you blasted idiot, what chance <em>can</em> you have?” He
grew depressed.</p>

<p>The door burst open. There was a flurry of skirts.
Dora, transfigured, rushed at him as he rose, words
pouring from her. Anthony was dazed.</p>

<p>He waved hands to stem the flood. Arms were
thrown about his neck. Warm lips were pressed to his
cheek. Another flurry—and she was gone.</p>

<p>Anthony looked after. “If you were your sister,
my dear,” said he to himself, “escape would’ve been
more difficult.”</p>

<p>The door opened again. This time it is Lucia,
composed now and more mistress of herself than for
days past. With relief, her sense of humour had
returned in full strength; there is nothing more
steadying than one’s sense of humour.</p>

<p>Anthony was still on his feet. She looked first at
him and then at the damp pages of the <i>Telegraph</i>
covering the chair. She began to laugh. He was well
content; the most seductive, the most pleasant sound
within his experience.</p>

<p>He stood smiling at her. The laughter grew.
Then, with an effort, she controlled it.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. Only I couldn’t help it. Really I
couldn’t!” Her tone was contrite.</p>

<p>“And why should you?” Anthony asked. “But I
hope you appreciate my tender care of your cushions.”</p>

<p>She seated herself, waving him back to his chair.
“Oh, I do! I think it was wonderful of you to—to
think about my furniture at a time like this. But then
you’re by way of being rather a wonderful person,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“You deceive yourself if you mean that,” said
Anthony. “A matter of common sense plus imagination;
that’s all. The mixture’s rare, I admit, but
there’s no food for wonder in it.” He hardly heard
his own words. He found clear thought an effort.
He wanted only to be left in peace to look at her and
look and look again. He found himself glad, somehow,
that to-night she was not in an evening gown.
The simplicity of her clothes, perfect though they were,
seemed to make her, paradoxically, less remote.</p>

<p>She smiled at him. “Now, please, you must tell
me all about everything.”</p>

<p>Anthony groaned.</p>

<p>“Pleeease.”</p>

<p>“Must I?” He raised feeble hands.</p>

<p>“Of course, you silly person, I don’t really mean
‘everything.’ How could I when you’re so tired, so
awfully tired! But you come here all strange and
mysterious and dramatic and simply tell us that Archie’s
all right. How <em>can</em> one help being curious? Why
is he all right? Have you only persuaded them that
he didn’t do it? Or have you shown them the person
that really did?”</p>

<p>“The second,” Anthony said, covertly feasting his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Who? Who?” She had risen in her excitement.</p>

<p>Anthony looked up at her, and looking, forgot the
question.</p>

<p>She stamped her foot. “Oh, you irritating man!”
she cried, and shook him by the shoulder. “Tell me
at once!”</p>

<p>“It was—Digby-Coates,” said Anthony slowly,
fearing the news might affect her deeply.</p>

<p>She took that in silence. Whether astonishment or
other emotions had affected her he could not at the
moment discern. Her next words told him.</p>

<p>“I suppose”—her tone was thoughtful—“that I
ought to be surprised. And horrified. But somehow
I’m not. I don’t mean, you know, that I ever suspected
him or anything like that. But I’m just not awfully
surprised, that’s all.”</p>

<p>It dawned upon Anthony that if he were not to
seem a boor he must make an effort at intelligence.
He strove to quiet the exuberant agility his heart
had exhibited since her hand had touched his
shoulder.</p>

<p>He did his best. “You didn’t like him, I gather,”
he said.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “No. Not that I really disliked
him. I just wasn’t quite comfortable whenever
he was with me. You know. I always had to be
nice, of course. Before my husband died they were
always together. You see, they had the same tastes.
They were about the same age, too.” She relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>“So they were much of an age, were they?”
Anthony said to himself. “Now, that’s illuminating.
Coates is over fifty.” He was about to speak aloud,
but was forestalled.</p>

<p>“What on earth must you think of me?” Lucia
cried. “Here are you, that’ve done all these miracles
for us, all tired and wet, and I’m sitting here as if
this was afternoon tea at the Vicar’s.” She ran to the
bell. “First, you must have a drink. Whisky?
That’s the second time I’ve forgotten my hospitality
when you’ve been here.”</p>

<p>Anthony got his drink. When he had finished the
second,</p>

<p>“You,” she said, “must go back to your inn.
And you’ll have to walk, poor thing. My little car’s
been out of action for a fortnight and I’ve sent away
the one we hired for to-day. But the walk may do
you good. You’ll get warm.”</p>

<p>Anthony set down his tumbler. “Exit Fairy
Godmother.”</p>

<p>The great eyes burned him with their reproach.</p>

<p>“That’s not fair,” she said, and Anthony could have
kicked himself. “You know it isn’t! What I want
to do is to offer you a bed here. Well, there’s a bed,
but nothing else. No razor. No pyjamas even.
You’d be uncomfortable. And you’ve simply <em>got</em> to
take care of yourself to-night!”</p>

<p>Anthony rose. “Forgive me. It seems my fate
always to be rude to you. And you’re quite right.”
He moved towards the door.</p>

<p>She followed him. With his fingers on the handle,
he paused. “Damn it!” he thought. “She’s hard
enough to resist when one’s in full command of oneself.
But now! Oh, Jupiter, aid me!”</p>

<p>He prepared to make his adieux. She touched him
on the arm.</p>

<p>“One more question before you go.” She smiled
at him, and Anthony caught his breath. “Was I—am
I—oh! I mean, is my evidence part of your case?
You know, about my being outside the window that
night—what I saw——”</p>

<p>“Two of my main objects,” Anthony said, “have
been to get Deacon off and to keep you and your
brother out. I think I’ve done both. I thought at
one time that I couldn’t round off the business without
dragging you in. But the gods were good and dropped
into my hands a little man who knew as much and a
deal more than you. I exulted. I still exult. Like
Stalky, I gloat!” He thumped his chest with an air.
“I know everything; but I shan’t tell. I know so much
that I could tell you almost to a minute what time it
was when you looked through the window of Hoode’s
study—and that’s more than you know yourself.
But I won’t tell. Your secret, lady, is safe with me!”</p>

<p>She laughed; but there was something more than
laughter in the sound.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said slowly, “that you are a very
perfect—Fairy Godmother! And now you must go,
or you’ll have pneumonia. And if you did you might
never hear those thanks I’m going to give you”—she
smiled, and he saw with wonder that the dark eyes were
glistening with tears—“<em>after</em> I’ve apologised for
behaving as I did the other night.” She paused; then
burst out: “And, please, will you shake hands?”</p>

<p>Anthony looked at the white fingers held out
towards him. The last shreds of self-control went
flying.</p>

<p>“No, by God, I won’t!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Lucia, amazed, was caught in long arms. Kisses
were rained upon her mouth, her eyes, her hair, her
throat. She strove with hands against his chest.</p>

<p>The great eyes blazed dark fire into his above them.
“Let go! Let go, I say! <em>Will</em> you let me go!” The
words came between her teeth.</p>

<p>Some measure of sanity returned to him. His
arms dropped to his sides. Lucia, released, fell back
against the wall. There she remained, hands behind
her and pressed her to the panelling. Her eyes (“God!
what eyes!” thought poor Anthony) never left his
face.</p>

<p>He said very heavily: “I suppose—I suppose I’ve
been presumptuous. Oh! I’ll grant you it was
unpardonable. But, Lord, there’s reason enough for my
madness. I know I’m ridiculous. I feel, believe me,
sufficient dislike of myself. But I make this excuse
for the inexcusable.” He paused and moistened his
lips. They were parched, dry.</p>

<p>The woman stayed half-leaning, half-crouching,
against the wall. Still those eyes were fixed upon his.</p>

<p>Anthony went on: “I offer this excuse, I say. It
is that I love you. Oh, I know I’m laughable! You
can tell me I’ve only known you for—what is
it?—three days. You can tell me that I have only been
in your company for a few—a very few—hours of
those days. You can tell me all this and more. You
can tell me that I know nothing of you nor you
of me. And to it all I answer: Days? Time?
Hours? Friendship? What have all these to do with
me? I love you.”</p>

<p>The diffidence born of contrition for his treatment
of her was fading fast. He came a step nearer.</p>

<p>“D’you hear what I say? I love you. I love you.
I love you! From the first moment I saw you—in
this room here—when I had come to make you tell me
what you knew, from that moment, in that moment,
I loved you.” He straightened himself and flung out
both hands in a gesture almost Latin. “And, by God,
can I be blamed? Can I be blamed for what I did
just now, I say? For a hundred hours that were a
hundred years I have been obsessed by you. Your
hair—that black net of beautiful magic; your eyes—those
great dark windows of your heart—they have been
with me all those hundred hours that were a life-time.
I have drowned my soul in those eyes of yours,
Madonna Lucia. I have——”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop, stop! What are you saying? This is
all madness! Madness!” She was erect now, hands
pressed to flaming cheeks.</p>

<p>But he would not stop. “Oh, I haven’t finished!”
He laughed—a wild sound. “Not yet. You say this
is madness. What is it that has made me mad? It
is you, you, you! You—your face, your body, all
the unbelievable wonder of you! You say that I am
mad. I say that I am sane. What could be saner
than a man who tells you, as I have told you,
that he loves you? For how could any man help
loving you? Madness, the real madness, would have
lain in not telling you.” He came close and caught her
hands and carried them to his lips. Fingers, palms,
wrists, he covered them with kisses.</p>

<p>He straightened himself and released her. “And
that,” he said wearily, “is that. I’m afraid I’ve
grown dramatic. Forgive me.”</p>

<p>She did not speak. Anthony looked down; he
could not trust himself to meet those eyes.</p>

<p>“And so now,” he said, “I’ll go.” He turned to
the door.</p>

<p>There came a voice from behind him.</p>

<p>“But—but”—it stammered deliciously —“but please,
I don’t <em>want</em> you to go. Please will you come back.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>“On Saturday,” said Anthony in his lady’s ear—one
chair held them both—“on Saturday we leave this
England. Before I’m wanted at this unpleasant trial
a fortnight or three weeks will elapse, if I know
anything of English justice. In that time, lady, we will
paint a girdle of colour about the earth—or some of
it at least.” His clasp tightened about her shoulders.
“Shall we? Shall we? I want to take you away, right
away! I want to show you places you’ve never seen
before though you may have been in them many times.
Where shall it be? Paris? Brittany? Sicily?
Madrid? Any’ll be a better heaven than is really possible.”</p>

<p>To their ears came the hum of a car. As they
listened, it grew louder; and yet louder. The car
swept up the drive; halted. Down the stairs and past
the door of the drawing-room came flying feet—Dora’s.</p>

<p>“Archie. It’s Archie!” Lucia struggled to free
herself.</p>

<p>Anthony held her closer. “Never mind Archibald,
Answer me, woman! Do we leave England on
Saturday?”</p>

<p>They heard the heavy front-door flung open; then
a cry of delight; then silence.</p>

<p>“Let me down! Oh, do let me down!” Lucia
begged. “Tony, pleeease! They’ll be in here in a
minute.”</p>

<p>He released her, only to snatch her to him again
when both were on their feet.</p>

<p>He held her close. “You’ve got to answer, you
know. Do we leave England——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. All right, all right! but haven’t you
forgotten something?” He felt laughter shake her body.</p>

<p>“Forgotten something?” he said. “No, don’t think so.”</p>

<p>She drew his face down to hers. “Don’t we get
married at all?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Hell!” said Anthony. “I’d forgotten that. Damn
it! That means we can’t go until Monday.”</p>

<p>They heard footsteps outside. Lucia wriggled free,
her face flaming.</p>

<p>The door burst open. “Here we are!” said Deacon,
enormous in the doorway. “The return of Crippen.
Most affectin’!” He advanced into the room.
“First: Gethryn, thank you.” He stretched out a
big hand and crushed Anthony’s.</p>

<p>Dora, entering in a rush, fell upon her sister. “Loo!
Loo!” she cried, “we’re going to be married! Soon!”</p>

<p>Lucia clutched at her and began to laugh. “Why,
darling,” she said, “I believe I am too.”</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>In town, Spencer Hastings and his betrothed were
discussing details.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Hastings, “A. R. Gethryn for
best man?”</p>

<p>Margaret patted his cheek. “It wouldn’t surprise
me, little man,” she said, “if we found he wasn’t
eligible.”</p>

<p class="finis">the end</p>

<ul>
  <li>“houeshold” has been changed to “household” (Chapter III).</li>
  <li>“nineeteen” has been changed to “nineteen” (Chapter V).</li>
  <li>“Hasting’s” has been changed to “Hastings’s” (Chapter VIII).</li>
  <li>“typwritten” has been changed to “typewritten” (Chapter XVII).</li>
  <li>“errudite” has been changed to “erudite” (Chapter XVII).</li>
  <li>“sayiyng” has been changed to “saying” (Chapter XVII).</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, two occurrences of unpaired quote marks have been
restored. All other apparent errors have been left unchanged.</p>

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™

</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
